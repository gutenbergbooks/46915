<span class="s7">TO THE</span><br />

<span class="s5">PRESENT TRANSLATION.</span></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> excellence of the following Treatise is so well known to all in any
tolerable degree conversant with the Art of Painting, that it would be
almost superfluous to say any thing respecting it, were it not that it
here appears under the form of a new translation, of which some account
may be expected.</p>

<p>Of the original Work, which is in reality a selection from the
voluminous manuscript collections of the Author, both in folio and
quarto, of all such passages as related to Painting, no<span class="pagenum">
<a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span> edition
appeared in print till 1651, though its Author died so long before as
the year 1519; and it is owing to the circumstance of a manuscript copy
of these extracts in the original Italian, having fallen into the hands
of Raphael du Fresne; that in the former of these years it was published
at Paris in a thin folio volume in that language, accompanied with a set
of cuts from the drawings of Nicolo Poussin, and Alberti; the former
having designed the human figures, the latter the geometrical and other
representations. This precaution was probably necessary, the sketches
in the Author&rsquo;s own collections being so very slight as not to be fit
for publication without further assistance. Poussin&rsquo;s drawings were mere
outlines, and the shadows and back-grounds behind the figures were added
by Errard, after the drawings had been made, and, as Poussin himself
says, without his knowledge.</p>

<p>In the same year, and size, and printed at the same place, a translation
of the original work into French was given to the world by Monsieur de
Chambray (well known, under<span class="pagenum">
<a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[Pg vii]</a></span> his family name of Freart, as the author
of an excellent Parallel of ancient and modern Architecture, in French,
which Mr. Evelyn translated into English). The style of this translation
by Mons. de Chambray, being thought, some years after, too antiquated,
some one was employed to revise and modernise it; and in 1716 a new
edition of it, thus polished, came out, of which it may be truly said,
as is in general the case on such occasions, that whatever the supposed
advantage obtained in purity and refinement of language might be, it was
more than counterbalanced by the want of the more valuable qualities of
accuracy, and fidelity to the original, from which, by these variations,
it became further removed.</p>

<p>The first translation of this Treatise into English, appeared in the
year 1721. It does not declare by whom it was made; but though it
professes to have been done from the original Italian, it is evident,
upon a comparison, that more use was made of the revised edition of
the French translation. Indifferent, however,<span class="pagenum">
<a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span> as it is, it had become
so scarce, and risen to a price so extravagant, that, to supply the
demand, it was found necessary, in the year 1796, to reprint it as it
stood, with all its errors on its head, no opportunity then offering of
procuring a fresh translation.</p>

<p>This last impression, however, being now also disposed of, and a new
one again called for, the present Translator was induced to step
forward, and undertake the office of fresh translating it, on finding,
by comparing the former versions both in French and English with the
original, many passages which he thought might at once be more concisely
and more faithfully rendered. His object, therefore, has been to attain
these ends, and as rules and precepts like the present allow but little
room for the decorations of style, he has been more solicitous for
fidelity, perspicuity, and precision, than for smooth sentences, and
well-turned periods.</p>

<p>Nor was this the only advantage which it was found the present
opportunity would afford; for the original work consisting in fact of
a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[Pg ix]</a></span> number of entries made at different times, without any regard to
their subjects, or attention to method, might rather in that state be
considered as a chaos of intelligence, than a well-digested treatise.
It has now, therefore, for the first time, been attempted to place
each chapter under the proper head or branch of the art to which
it belongs; and by so doing, to bring together those which (though
related and nearly connected in substance) stood, according to the
original arrangement, at such a distance from each other as to make
it troublesome to find them even by the assistance of an index; and
difficult, when found, to compare them together.</p>

<p>The consequence of this plan, it must be confessed, has been, that in
a few instances the same precept has been found in substance repeated;
but this is so far from being an objection, that it evidently proves
the precepts were not the hasty opinions of the moment, but settled and
fixed principles in the mind of the Author, and that he was consistent
in the expression of his sentiments.<span class="pagenum">
<a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</a></span> But if this mode of arrangement
has in the present case disclosed what might have escaped observation,
it has also been productive of more material advantages; for, besides
facilitating the finding of any particular passage (an object in itself
of no small importance), it clearly shews the work to be a much more
complete system than those best acquainted with it, had before any idea
of, and that many of the references in it apparently to other writings
of the same Author, relate in fact only to the present, the chapters
referred to having been found in it. These are now pointed out in the
notes, and where any obscurity has occurred in the text, the reader will
find some assistance at least attempted by the insertion of a note to
solve the difficulty.</p>

<p>No pains or expense have been spared in preparing the present work
for the press. The cuts have been re-engraven with more attention
to correctness in the drawing, than those which accompanied the two
editions of the former English translation possessed (even though they
had been fresh engraven for the impression of<span class="pagenum">
<a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[Pg xi]</a></span> 1796); and the diagrams
are now inserted in their proper places in the text, instead of being,
as before, collected all together in two plates at the end. Besides
this, a new Life of the Author has been also added by a Friend of the
Translator, the materials for which have been furnished, not from vague
reports, or uncertain conjectures, but from memoranda of the Author
himself, not before used.</p>

<p>Fortunately for this undertaking, the manuscript collections of Leonardo
da Vinci, which have lately passed from Italy into France, have, since
their removal thither, been carefully inspected, and an abstract of
their contents published in a quarto pamphlet, printed at Paris in 1797,
and intitled, &ldquo;Essai sur les Ouvrages physico-mathematiques de Leonard
de Vinci;&rdquo; by J. B. Venturi, Professor of Natural Philosophy at Modena;
a Member of the Institute of Bologna, &amp;c. From this pamphlet a great
deal of original intelligence respecting the Author has been obtained,
which, derived as it is from his own information, could not possibly be
founded on better evidence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[Pg xii]</a></span></p>

<p>To this Life we shall refer the reader for a further account of the
origin and history of the present Treatise, conceiving we have already
effected our purpose, by here giving him a sufficient idea of what he is
to expect from the ensuing pages.</p>

son of Pietro da Vinci, a notary of Vinci, in Tuscany<a name="FNanchor_I._1"
id="FNanchor_I._1"></a><a href="#Footnote_I._1" class="fnanchor">[i1]</a>, a village
situated in the valley of Arno, a little below Florence, and was born in
the year 1452<a name="FNanchor_II._2" id="FNanchor_II._2"></a><a href="#Footnote_II._2" class="fnanchor">[i2]</a>.</p>

<p>Having discovered, when a child, a strong inclination and talent for
painting, of which he had given proofs by several little drawings and
sketches; his father one day accidentally took up some of them, and
was induced to shew them to his friend Andrea Verocchio, a painter of
some reputation in Florence, who was also a<span class="pagenum">
<a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[Pg xiv]</a></span> chaser, an architect, a
sculptor, and goldsmith, for his advice, as to the propriety of bringing
up his son to the profession of painting, and the probability of his
becoming eminent in the art. The answer of Verocchio was such as to
confirm him in that resolution; and Leonardo, to fit him for that
purpose, was accordingly placed under the tuition of Verocchio<a name="FNanchor_III._3" id="FNanchor_III._3"></a><a href="#Footnote_III._3" class="fnanchor">[i3]</a>.</p>

<p>As Verocchio combined in himself a perfect knowledge of the arts of
chasing and sculpture, and was a deep proficient in architecture,
Leonardo had in this situation the means and opportunity of acquiring a
variety of information, which though perhaps not immediately connected
with the art to which his principal attention was to be directed,
might, with the assistance of such a mind as Leonardo&rsquo;s, be rendered
subsidiary to his grand object, tend to promote his knowledge of the
theory, and facilitate his practice of the profession for which he
was intended. Accordingly we find that he had the good sense to avail
himself of these advantages, and that under Verocchio he made great
progress, and attracted his master&rsquo;s friendship and confidence, by the
talents he discovered, the sweetness of his manners, and the vivacity
of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[Pg xv]</a></span> disposition<a name="FNanchor_IV._4" id="FNanchor_IV._4"></a><a href="#Footnote_IV._4" class="fnanchor">[i4]</a>. Of his proficiency in painting, the following
instance is recorded; and the skill he afterwards manifested in other
branches of science, on various occasions, evidently demonstrated how
solicitous he had been for knowledge of all kinds, and how careful in
his youth to lay a good foundation. Verocchio had undertaken for the
religious of Vallombrosa, without Florence, a picture of our Saviour&rsquo;s
Baptism by St. John, and consigned to Leonardo the office of putting
in from the original drawing, the figure of an angel holding up the
drapery; but, unfortunately for Verocchio, Leonardo succeeded so well,
that, despairing of ever equalling the work of his scholar, Verocchio
in disgust abandoned his pencil for ever, confining himself in future
solely to the practice of sculpture<a name="FNanchor_V._5" id="FNanchor_V._5"></a><a href="#Footnote_V._5" class="fnanchor">[i5]</a>.</p>

<p>On this success Leonardo became sensible that he no longer stood in
need of an instructor; and therefore quitting Verocchio, he now began
to work and study for himself. Many of his performances of this period
are still, or were lately to be seen at Florence; and besides these,
the following have been also mentioned: A cartoon of Adam and Eve in
the Garden, which he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[Pg xvi]</a></span> did for the King of Portugal<a name="FNanchor_VI._6" id="FNanchor_VI._6"></a><a href="#Footnote_VI._6" class="fnanchor">[i6]</a>. This is highly
commended for the exquisite gracefulness of the two principal figures,
the beauty of the landscape, and the incredible exactitude of the shrubs
and fruit. At the instance of his father, he made a painting for one of
his old neighbours at Vinci<a name="FNanchor_VII._7" id="FNanchor_VII._7"></a><a href="#Footnote_VII._7" class="fnanchor">[i7]</a>; it consisted wholly of such animals
as have naturally an hatred to each other, joined artfully together in
a variety of attitudes. Some authors have said that this painting was a
shield<a name="FNanchor_VIII._8" id="FNanchor_VIII._8"></a><a href="#Footnote_VIII._8" class="fnanchor">[i8]</a>, and have related the following particulars respecting it.</p>

<p>One of Pietro&rsquo;s neighbours meeting him one day at Florence, told him he
had been making a shield, and would be glad of his assistance to get it
painted; Pietro undertook this office, and applied to his son to make
good the promise. When the shield was brought to Leonardo, he found it
so ill made, that he was obliged to get a turner to smooth it; and when
that was done, he began to consider with what subject he should paint
it. For this purpose he got together, in his apartment, a collection of
live animals, such as lizards, crickets, serpents, silk-worms, locusts,
bats, and other creatures of that kind, from the multitude of which,
variously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">[Pg xvii]</a>
</span> adapted to each other, he formed an horrible and terrific
animal, emitting fire and poison from his jaws, flames from his eyes,
and smoke from his nostrils; and with so great earnestness did Leonardo
apply to this, that though in his apartment the stench of the animals
that from time to time died there, was so strong as to be scarcely
tolerable, he, through his love to the art, entirely disregarded it.
The work being finished, Leonardo told his father he might now see it;
and the father one morning coming to his apartment for that purpose,
Leonardo, before he admitted him, placed the shield so as to receive
from the window its full and proper light, and then opened the door. Not
knowing what he was to expect, and little imagining that what he saw was
not the creatures themselves, but a mere painted representation of them,
the father, on entering and beholding the shield, was at first staggered
and shocked; which the son perceiving, told him he might now send the
shield to his friend, as, from the effect which the sight of it had
then produced, he found he had attained the object at which he aimed.
Pietro, however, had too much sagacity not to see that this was by much
too great a curiosity for a mere countryman, who would never be sensible
of its value; he therefore privately bought for his friend an ordinary<span class="pagenum">
<a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">[Pg xviii]</a></span>
shield, rudely painted with the device of an heart with an arrow through
it, and sold this for an hundred ducats to some merchants at Florence,
by whom it was again sold for three hundred to the Duke of Milan<a name="FNanchor_IX._9" id="FNanchor_IX._9"></a><a href="#Footnote_IX._9" class="fnanchor">[i9]</a>.</p>

<p>He afterwards painted a picture of the Virgin Mary, and by her side a
vessel of water, in which were flowers: in this he so contrived it, as
that the light reflected from the flowers threw a pale redness on the
water. This picture was at one time in the possession of Pope Clement
the Seventh<a name="FNanchor_X._10" id="FNanchor_X._10"></a><a href="#Footnote_X._10" class="fnanchor">[i10]</a>.</p>

<p>For his friend Antonio Segni he also made a design, representing Neptune
in his car, drawn by sea-horses, and attended by tritons and sea-gods;
the heavens overspread with clouds, which were driven in all directions
by the violence of the winds; the waves appeared to be rolling, and the
whole ocean seemed in an uproar<a name="FNanchor_XI._11" id="FNanchor_XI._11"></a><a href="#Footnote_XI._11" class="fnanchor">[i11]</a>. This drawing was afterwards given
by Fabio the son of Antonio Segni, to Giovanni Gaddi, a great collector
of drawings, with this epigram:</p>

<div class="container-center">
  <div class="container-left" lang="la" xml:lang="la">
    <div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse">Pinxit Virgilius Neptunum, pinxit Homerus,</div>

    </div>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xix" id="Page_xix">[Pg xix]</a></span></p>

<p>In English thus:</p>

<div class="container-center">
  <div class="container-left">
    <div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse">Virgil and Homer, when they Neptune shew&rsquo;d,</div>
      <div class="verse indent1">As he through boist&rsquo;rous seas his steeds compell&rsquo;d,</div>

       id="FNanchor_XIII._13"></a><a href="#Footnote_XIII._13" class="fnanchor">[i13]</a>.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>To these must be added the following: A painting representing two
horsemen engaged in fight, and struggling to tear a flag from each
other: rage and fury are in this admirably expressed in the countenances
of the two combatants; their air appears wild, and the drapery is thrown
into an unusual though agreeable disorder. A Medusa&rsquo;s head, and a
picture of the Adoration of the Magi<a name="FNanchor_XIV._14" id="FNanchor_XIV._14"></a><a href="#Footnote_XIV._14" class="fnanchor">[i14]</a>. In this last there are some
fine heads, but both this and the Medusa&rsquo;s head are said by Du Fresne to
have been evidently unfinished.</p>

<p>The mind of Leonardo was however too active and capacious to be
contented solely with the practical part of his art; nor could it submit
to receive as principles, conclusions, though confirmed by experience,
without first tracing them to their source, and investigating their
causes, and the several circumstances on which they depended.<span class="pagenum">
<a name="Page_xx" id="Page_xx">[Pg xx]</a></span> For this
purpose he determined to engage in a deep examination into the theory of
his art; and the better to effect his intention, he resolved to call in
to his aid the assistance of all such other branches of science as could
in any degree promote this grand object.</p>

<p>Vasari has related<a name="FNanchor_XV._15" id="FNanchor_XV._15"></a><a href="#Footnote_XV._15" class="fnanchor">[i15]</a>, that at a very early age he had, in the short
time of a few months only that he applied to it, obtained a deep
knowledge of arithmetic; and says, that in literature in general, he
would have made great attainments, if he had not been too versatile
to apply long to one subject. In music, he adds, he had made some
progress; that he then determined to learn to play on the lyre; and
that having an uncommonly fine voice, and an extraordinary promptitude
of thought and expression, he became a celebrated <i>improvisatore</i>: but
that his attention to these did not induce him to neglect painting and
modelling in which last art he was so great a proficient, that in his
youth he modelled in clay some heads of women laughing, and also some
boys&rsquo; heads, which appeared to have come from the hand of a master. In
architecture, he made many plans and designs for buildings, and, while
he was yet young, proposed conveying<span class="pagenum">
<a name="Page_xxi" id="Page_xxi">[Pg xxi]</a></span> the river Arno into the canal
at Pisa<a name="FNanchor_XVI._16" id="FNanchor_XVI._16"></a><a href="#Footnote_XVI._16" class="fnanchor">[i16]</a>. Of his skill in poetry the reader may judge from the
following sonnet preserved by Lomazzo<a name="FNanchor_XVII._17" id="FNanchor_XVII._17"></a><a href="#Footnote_XVII._17" class="fnanchor">[i17]</a>, the only one now existing
of his composition; and for the translation with which it is accompanied
we are indebted to a lady.</p>

<p>The course of study which Leonardo had thus undertaken, would, in its
most limited extent by any one who should attempt it at this time, be
found perhaps almost more than could be successfully accomplished;
but yet his curiosity and unbounded thirst for information, induced
him rather to enlarge than contract his plan. Accordingly we find,
that to the study of geometry, sculpture, anatomy, he added those
of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiii" id="Page_xxiii">[Pg xxiii]</a></span> architecture, mechanics, optics, hydrostatics, astronomy, and
Nature in general, in all her operations<a name="FNanchor_XVIII._18" id="FNanchor_XVIII._18"></a><a href="#Footnote_XVIII._18" class="fnanchor">[i18]</a>; and the result of
his observations and experiments, which were intended not only for
present use, but as the basis and foundation of future discoveries, he
determined, as he proceeded, to commit to writing. At what time he began
these his collections, of which we shall have occasion to speak more
particularly hereafter, is no where mentioned; but it is with certainty
known, that by the month of April 1490, he had already completely filled
two folio volumes<a name="FNanchor_XIX._19" id="FNanchor_XIX._19"></a><a href="#Footnote_XIX._19" class="fnanchor">[i19]</a>.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding Leonardo&rsquo;s propensity and application to study, he was
not inattentive to the graces of external accomplishments; he was very
skilful in the management of an horse, rode gracefully, and when he
afterwards arrived to a state of affluence, took particular pleasure in
appearing in public well mounted and handsomely accoutred. He possessed
great dexterity in the use of arms: for mien and grace he might contend
with any gentleman of his time: his person was remarkably handsome, his
behaviour so perfectly polite, and his conversation so charming, that
his company was coveted by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiv" id="Page_xxiv">[Pg xxiv]</a>
</span> all who knew him; but the avocations to
which this last circumstance subjected him, are one reason why so many
of his works remain unfinished<a name="FNanchor_XX._20" id="FNanchor_XX._20"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_XX._20" class="fnanchor">[i20]</a>.</p>

<p>With such advantages of mind and body as these, it was no wonder that
his reputation should spread itself, as we find it soon did, over all
Italy. The painting of the shield before mentioned, had already, as has
been noticed, come into the possession of the Duke of Milan; and the
subsequent accounts which he had from time to time heard of Leonardo&rsquo;s
abilities and talents, induced Lodovic Sforza, surnamed the Moor, then
Duke of Milan, about, or a little before the year 1489<a name="FNanchor_XXI._21"
id="FNanchor_XXI._21"></a><a href="#Footnote_XXI._21" class="fnanchor">[i21]</a>, to invite
him to his court, and to settle on him a pension of five hundred crowns,
a considerable sum at that time<a name="FNanchor_XXII._22" id="FNanchor_XXII._22">
</a><a href="#Footnote_XXII._22" class="fnanchor">[i22]</a>.</p>

<p>Various are the reasons assigned for this invitation: Vasari<a name="FNanchor_XXIII._23"
id="FNanchor_XXIII._23"></a><a href="#Footnote_XXIII._23" class="fnanchor">[i23]</a>
attributes it to his skill in music, a science of which the Duke is
said to have been fond; others have ascribed it to a design which the
Duke entertained of erecting a brazen statue to the memory of his
father<a name="FNanchor_XXIV._24" id="FNanchor_XXIV._24"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_XXIV._24" class="fnanchor">[i24]</a>; but others conceive<span class="pagenum">
<a name="Page_xxv" id="Page_xxv">[Pg xxv]</a></span> it originated from the circumstance,
that the Duke had not long before established at Milan an academy for
the study of painting, sculpture, and architecture, and was desirous
that Leonardo should take the conduct and direction of it<a name="FNanchor_XXV._25"
id="FNanchor_XXV._25"></a><a href="#Footnote_XXV._25" class="fnanchor">[i25]</a>. The
second was, however, we find, the true motive; and we are further
informed, that the invitation was accepted by Leonardo, that he went to
Milan, and was already there in 1489<a name="FNanchor_XXVI._26" id="FNanchor_XXVI._26">
</a><a href="#Footnote_XXVI._26" class="fnanchor">[i26]</a>.</p>

<p>Among the collections of Leonardo still existing in manuscript, is a
copy of a memorial presented by him to the Duke about 1490, of which
Venturi has given an abridgment<a name="FNanchor_XXVII._27" id="FNanchor_XXVII._27"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_XXVII._27" class="fnanchor">[i27]</a>. In it he offers to make for
the Duke military bridges, which should be at the same time light and
very solid, and to teach him the method of placing and defending them
with security. When the object is to take any place, he can, he says,
empty the ditch of its water; he knows, he adds, the art of constructing
a subterraneous gallery under the ditches themselves, and of carrying
it to the very spot that shall be wanted. If the fort is not built
on a rock, he undertakes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxvi" id="Page_xxvi">[Pg xxvi]</a>
</span> to throw it down, and mentions that he has
new contrivances for bombarding machines, ordnance, and mortars, some
adapted to throw hail shot, fire, and smoke, among the enemy; and
for all other machines proper for a siege, and for war, either by
sea or land, according to circumstances. In peace also, he says he
can be useful in what concerns the erection of buildings, conducting
of water-courses, sculpture in bronze or marble, and painting; and
remarks, that at the same time that he may be pursuing any of the above
objects, the equestrian statue to the memory of the Duke&rsquo;s father, and
his illustrious family, may still be going on. If any one doubts the
possibility of what he proposes, he offers to prove it by experiment,
and ocular demonstration.</p>

<p>From this memorial it seems clear, that the casting of the bronze statue
was his principal object; painting is only mentioned incidentally,
and no notice is taken of the direction or management of the academy
for painting, sculpture, and architecture; it is probable, therefore,
that at this time there was no such intention, though it is certainly
true, that he was afterwards placed at the head of it, and that he
banished from it the barbarous style of architecture which till then had
prevailed in it, and introduced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxvii"
id="Page_xxvii">[Pg xxvii]</a></span> in its stead a more pure and classical
taste. Whatever was the fact with respect to the academy, it is however
well known that the statue was cast in bronze, finished, and put up at
Milan, but afterwards demolished by the French when they took possession
of that place<a name="FNanchor_XXVIII._28" id="FNanchor_XXVIII._28"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_XXVIII._28" class="fnanchor">[i28]</a> after the defeat of Lodovic Sforza.</p>

<p>Some time after Leonardo&rsquo;s arrival at Milan, a design had been
entertained of cutting a canal from Martesana to Milan, for the purpose
of opening a communication by water between these two places, and, as
it is said, of supplying the last with water. It had been first thought
of so early as 1457<a name="FNanchor_XXIX._29" id="FNanchor_XXIX._29"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_XXIX._29" class="fnanchor">[i29]</a>; but from the difficulties to be expected
in its execution, it seems to have been laid aside, or at least to
have proceeded slowly, till Leonardo&rsquo;s arrival. His offers of service
as engineer in the above memorial, probably induced Lodovic Sforza,
the then Duke, to resume the intention with vigour, and accordingly we
find the plan was determined on, and the execution of it intrusted to
Leonardo. The object was noble, but the difficulties to be encountered
were sufficient to have discouraged any mind but Leonardo&rsquo;s; for the
distance was no less than two hundred miles; and before it could be
completed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxviii" id="Page_xxviii">[Pg xxviii]</a>
</span> hills were to be levelled, and vallies filled up, to render
them navigable with security<a name="FNanchor_XXX._30" id="FNanchor_XXX._30"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_XXX._30" class="fnanchor">[i30]</a>.</p>

<p>In order to enable him to surmount the obstacles with which he foresaw
he should have to contend, he retired to the house of his friend Signior
Melzi, at Vaverola, not far distant from Milan, and there applied
himself sedulously for some years, as it is said, but at intervals only
we must suppose, and according as his undertaking proceeded, to the
study of philosophy, mathematics, and every branch of science that could
at all further his design; still continuing the method he had before
adopted, of entering down in writing promiscuously, whatever he wished
to implant in his memory: and at this place, in this and his subsequent
visits from time to time, he is supposed to have made the greater part
of the collections he has left behind him<a name="FNanchor_XXXI._31" id="FNanchor_XXXI._31"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_XXXI._31" class="fnanchor">[i31]</a>, of the contents of
which we shall hereafter speak more at large.</p>

<p>Although engaged in the conduct of so vast an undertaking, and in
studies so extensive, the mind of Leonardo does not appear to have
been so wholly occupied or absorbed in them as to incapacitate him
from attending at the same time to other objects also; and the Duke
therefore being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxix" id="Page_xxix">[Pg xxix]</a>
</span> desirous of ornamenting Milan with some specimens of
his skill as a painter, employed him to paint in the refectory of the
Dominican convent of Santa Maria delle Gratie, in that city, a picture,
the subject of which was to be the Last Supper. Of this picture it is
related, that Leonardo was so impressed with the dignity of the subject,
and so anxious to answer the high ideas he had formed of it in his own
mind, that his progress was very slow, and that he spent much time in
meditation and thought, during which the work was apparently at a stand.
The Prior of the convent, thinking it therefore neglected, complained
to the Duke; but Leonardo assuring the Duke that not less than two
hours were every day bestowed on it, he was satisfied. Nevertheless
the Prior, after a short time, finding the work very little advanced,
once more applied to the Duke, who in some degree of anger, as thinking
Leonardo had deceived him, reprimanded him in strong terms for his
delay. What Leonardo had scorned to urge to the Prior in his defence,
he now thought fit to plead in his excuse to the Duke, to convince him
that a painter did not labour solely with his hands, but that his mind
might be deeply studying his subject, when his hands were unemployed,
and he in appearance perfectly idle. In proof of this, he told the
Duke<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxx" id="Page_xxx">[Pg xxx]</a>
</span> that nothing remained to the completion of the picture but the
heads of our Saviour and Judas; that as to the former, he had not yet
been able to find a fit model to express its divinity, and found his
invention inadequate of itself to represent it: that with respect to
that of Judas, he had been in vain for two years searching among the
most abandoned and profligate of the species for an head which would
convey an idea of his character; but that this difficulty was now at
length removed, since he had nothing to do but to introduce the head of
the Prior, whose ingratitude for the pains he was taking, rendered him a
fit archetype of the perfidy and ingratitude he wished to express. Some
persons have said<a name="FNanchor_XXXII._32" id="FNanchor_XXXII._32"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_XXXII._32" class="fnanchor">[i32]</a>, that the head
of Judas in the picture was
actually copied from that of the Prior; but Mariette denies it, and says
this reply was merely intended as a threat<a name="FNanchor_XXXIII._33"
id="FNanchor_XXXIII._33"></a><a href="#Footnote_XXXIII._33" class="fnanchor">[i33]</a>.</p>

<p>A difference of opinion has also prevailed concerning the head of our
Saviour in this picture; for some have conceived it left intentionally
unfinished<a name="FNanchor_XXXIV._34" id="FNanchor_XXXIV._34"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_XXXIV._34" class="fnanchor">[i34]</a>, while others
think there is a<span class="pagenum"> <a name="Page_xxxi" id="Page_xxxi">[Pg xxxi]</a>
</span> gradation of
resemblance, which increasing in beauty in St. John and our Saviour,
shews in the dignified countenance of the latter a spark of his divine
majesty. In the countenance of the Redeemer, say these last, and in
that of Judas, is excellently expressed the extreme idea of God made
man, and of the most perfidious of mortals. This is also pursued in the
characters nearest to each of them<a name="FNanchor_XXXV._35" id="FNanchor_XXXV._35">
</a><a href="#Footnote_XXXV._35" class="fnanchor">[i35]</a>.</p>

<p>Little judgment can now be formed of the original beauty of this
picture, which has been, and apparently with very good reason, highly
commended. Unfortunately, though it is said to have been in oil, the
wall on which it was painted not having been properly prepared, the
original colours have been so effectually defaced by the damp, as to
be no longer visible<a name="FNanchor_XXXVI._36" id="FNanchor_XXXVI._36"></a><a href="#Footnote_XXXVI._36" class="fnanchor">[i36]</a>; and the fathers, for whose use it was
painted, thinking it entirely destroyed, and some years since wishing
to heighten and widen a door under it, leading out of their refectory,
have given a decided proof of their own want of taste, and how little
they were sensible of its value, by permitting the workmen to break
through the wall on which it was painted, and, by so doing, entirely to
destroy the lower part of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxii"
id="Page_xxxii">[Pg xxxii]</a></span> the picture<a name="FNanchor_XXXVII._37"
id="FNanchor_XXXVII._37"></a><a href="#Footnote_XXXVII._37" class="fnanchor">[i37]</a>.
The injury done by the
damp to the colouring has been, it is true, in some measure repaired by
Michael Angelo Bellotti, a painter of Milan, who viewing the picture
in 1726, made an offer to the Prior and convent to restore, by means
of a secret which he possessed, the original colours. His proposition
being accepted, and the experiment succeeding beyond their hopes, the
convent made him a present of five hundred pounds for his labour, and
he in return communicated to them the secret by which it had been
effected<a name="FNanchor_XXXVIII._38" id="FNanchor_XXXVIII._38"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_XXXVIII._38" class="fnanchor">[i38]</a>.</p>

<p>Deprived, as they certainly are by these events, of the means of judging
accurately of the merit of the original, it is still some consolation
to the lovers of painting, that several copies of it made by Leonardo&rsquo;s
scholars, many of whom were very able artists, and at a time when the
picture had not been yet injured, are still in existence.<span class="pagenum">
<a name="Page_xxxiii" id="Page_xxxiii">[Pg xxxiii]</a></span> A list of
these copies is given by P. M. Guglielmo della Valle, in his edition
of Vasari&rsquo;s Lives of the Painters, in Italian, vol. v. p. 34, and from
him it is here inserted in the note<a name="FNanchor_XXXIX._39" id="FNanchor_XXXIX._39">
</a><a href="#Footnote_XXXIX._39" class="fnanchor">[i39]</a>. Francis the<span class="pagenum">
<a name="Page_xxxiv" id="Page_xxxiv">[Pg xxxiv]</a></span> First was so
charmed on viewing the original, that not being able to remove it, he
had a copy made, which is now, or was some years since, at St. Germains,
and several prints have been published from it; but the best which has
yet appeared (and very fine it is) is one not long since engraven by
Morghen, at Rome, impressions of which have found their way into this
country, and been sold, it is said, for ten or twelve guineas each.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxv" id="Page_xxxv">[Pg xxxv]</a></span></p>

<p>In the same refectory of the Dominicans at Milan is, or was, also
preserved a painting by Leonardo, representing Duke Lodovic, and Beatrix
his duchess, on their knees; done no doubt about this time<a name="FNanchor_XL._40" id="FNanchor_XL._40"></a><a href="#Footnote_XL._40" class="fnanchor">[i40]</a>. And at
or near this period, he also painted for the Duke the Nativity, which
was formerly, and may perhaps be still, in the Emperor of Germany&rsquo;s
collection<a name="FNanchor_XLI._41" id="FNanchor_XLI._41"></a><a href="#Footnote_XLI._41" class="fnanchor">[i41]</a>.</p>

<p>As Leonardo&rsquo;s principal aim, whenever he was left at liberty to pursue
the bent of his own inclination, seems to have been progressive
improvement in the art of painting, he appears to have sedulously
embraced all opportunities of increasing his information; and wisely
perceiving, that without a thorough acquaintance with anatomy, a painter
could effect but little, he was particularly desirous of extending his
knowledge in that branch. For that purpose he had frequent conferences
on the subject with Marc Antonio della Torre, professor of anatomy at
Pavia<a name="FNanchor_XLII._42" id="FNanchor_XLII._42"></a><a href="#Footnote_XLII._42" class="fnanchor">[i42]</a>, and not only was present at many dissections performed
by him, but made abundance of anatomical drawings from Nature, many of
which were afterwards collected into a volume by his scholar Francisco
Melzi<a name="FNanchor_XLIII._43" id="FNanchor_XLIII._43"></a><a href="#Footnote_XLIII._43" class="fnanchor">[i43]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxvi" id="Page_xxxvi">[Pg xxxvi]</a></span></p>

<p>Such perseverance and assiduity as Leonardo&rsquo;s, united as they were
with such uncommon powers as his, had already formed many artists at
that time of distinguished reputation, but who afterwards became still
more famous, and might probably have rendered Milan the repository
of some of the most valuable specimens of painting, and raised it to
a rank little, if at all, inferior to that which Florence has since
held with the admirers of the polite arts, had it not happened that by
the disastrous termination of a contest between the Duke of Milan and
the French, all hopes of further improvement were entirely cut off;
and Milan, at one blow, lost all the advantages of which it was even
then in possession. For about this time the troubles in Italy began
to break in on Leonardo&rsquo;s quiet, and he found his patron, the Duke,
engaged in a war with the French for the possession of his dukedom;
which not only endangered the academy, but ultimately deprived him both
of his dominions and his liberty; as the Duke was, in 1500, completely
defeated, taken prisoner, and carried into France, where, in 1510, he
died a prisoner in the castle of Loches<a name="FNanchor_XLIV._44" id="FNanchor_XLIV._44"></a><a href="#Footnote_XLIV._44" class="fnanchor">[i44]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxvii" id="Page_xxxvii">[Pg xxxvii]</a></span></p>

<p>By this event of the Duke&rsquo;s defeat, and the consequent ruin of the
Sforza family, all further progress in the canal of Martesana, of which
much still remained to be done<a name="FNanchor_XLV._45" id="FNanchor_XLV._45"></a><a href="#Footnote_XLV._45" class="fnanchor">[i45]</a>, was put a stop to; the academy
of architecture and painting was entirely broken up; the professors
were turned adrift, and the arts banished from Milan, which at one
time had promised to have been their refuge and principal feat<a name="FNanchor_XLVI._46" id="FNanchor_XLVI._46"></a><a href="#Footnote_XLVI._46" class="fnanchor">[i46]</a>.
Italy in general was, it is true, a gainer by the dispersion of so many
able and deeply instructed artists as issued from this school, though
Milan suffered; for nothing could so much tend to the dissemination
of knowledge as the mixing such men among others who needed that
information in which these excelled. Among the number thus separated
from each other, we find painters, carvers, architects, founders, and
engravers in crystal and precious stones, and the names of the following
have been given, as the principal: Cesare da Sesto, Andrea Salaino, Gio.
Antonio Boltraffio, Bernardino Lovino, Bartolommeo della Porta, Lorenzo
Lotto<a name="FNanchor_XLVII._47" id="FNanchor_XLVII._47"></a><a href="#Footnote_XLVII._47" class="fnanchor">[i47]</a>. To these has been added Gio. Paolo Lomazzo; but Della
Valle, in a note in his edition of Vasari, vol. v. p.<span class="pagenum">
<a name="Page_xxxviii" id="Page_xxxviii">[Pg xxxviii]</a></span> 34, says this
last was a disciple of Gio. Battista della Cerva, and not of Leonardo.
Du Fresne mentions besides the above, Francis Melzi, Mark Uggioni Gobbo,
an extraordinary painter and carver; Annibal Fontana, a worker in marble
and precious stones; and Bernazzano, an excellent painter of landscapes;
but omits Della Porta, and Lorenzo Lotto.</p>

<p>In 1499, the year before Duke Lodovic&rsquo;s defeat, Leonardo being at Milan,
was employed by the principal inhabitants to contrive an automaton
for the entertainment of Lewis XII. King of France, who was expected
shortly to make a public entry into that city. This Leonardo did, and
it consisted of a machine representing a lion, whose inside was so well
constructed of clockwork, that it marched out to meet the King, made a
stand when it came before him, reared up on its hinder legs, and opening
its breast, presented an escutcheon with fleurs de lis quartered on
it<a name="FNanchor_XLVIII._48" id="FNanchor_XLVIII._48"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_XLVIII._48" class="fnanchor">[i48]</a>.
Lomazzo has said that this machine was made for the entry
of Francis the First; but he is mistaken, that prince having never been
at Milan till the year 1515<a name="FNanchor_XLIX._49" id="FNanchor_XLIX._49">
</a><a href="#Footnote_XLIX._49" class="fnanchor">[i49]</a>, at which time
Leonardo was at Rome.</p>

<p>Compelled by the disorders of Lombardy, the<span class="pagenum">
<a name="Page_xxxix" id="Page_xxxix">[Pg xxxix]</a></span> misfortunes of his patron,
and the ruin of the Sforza family, to quit Milan, Leonardo betook
himself to Florence, and his inducements to this resolution seem to
have been the residence there of the Medici family, the great patrons
of arts, and the good taste of its principal inhabitants<a name="FNanchor_L._50"
id="FNanchor_L._50"></a><a href="#Footnote_L._50" class="fnanchor">[i50]</a>, rather
than its vicinity to the place of his birth; for which, under the
circumstances that attended that event, it is not probable he could
entertain much, if any predilection. The first work which he here
undertook was a design for an altar-piece for the chapel of the college
of the Annunciati. Its subject was, our Saviour, with his mother, St.
Ann, and St. John; but though this drawing is said to have rendered
Leonardo very popular among his countrymen, to so great a degree, that
numbers of people went to see it, it does not appear that any picture
was painted from it, nor that the undertaking ever proceeded farther
than a sketch of a design, or rather, perhaps, a finished drawing. When
Leonardo some years afterwards went into France<a name="FNanchor_LI._51"
id="FNanchor_LI._51"></a><a href="#Footnote_LI._51" class="fnanchor">[i51]</a>, Francis the First
was desirous of having a picture from this drawing, and at his desire
he then put it into colours; but whether even this last was a regular
picture, or, which is more proba<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xl"
id="Page_xl">[Pg xl]</a></span>ble, only a coloured drawing, we are
not informed.</p>

<p>The picture, however, on which he bestowed the most time and labour,
and which therefore seems intended by him as the completest specimen of
his skill, at least in the branch of portrait-painting, was that which
he did of Mona Lisa, better known by the appellation of la Gioconda, a
Florentine lady, the wife of Francisco del Giocondo. It was painted for
her husband, afterwards purchased by Francis the First, and was till
lately to be seen in the King of France&rsquo;s cabinet. Leonardo bestowed
four entire years upon it, and after all is said to have left it
unfinished<a name="FNanchor_LII._52" id="FNanchor_LII._52"></a><a href="#Footnote_LII._52" class="fnanchor">[i52]</a>.</p>

<p>This has been so repeatedly said of the works of this painter, that we
are here induced to inquire into the evidence of the fact. An artist
who feels by experience, as every one must, how far short of the ideas
of perfection he has formed in his own mind, his best performances
always fall, will naturally be led to consider these as but very
faint expressions of his own conceptions. Leonardo&rsquo;s disposition to
think nothing effected while any thing remained to be done, and a
mind like his, continually suggesting successive<span class="pagenum">
<a name="Page_xli" id="Page_xli">[Pg xli]</a></span> improvements, might
therefore, and most probably did produce in him an opinion that his
own most laboured pieces were far from being finished to that extent
of beauty which he wished to give them; and these sentiments of them
he might in all likelihood be frequently heard to declare. Comparing
his productions, however, with those of other masters, they will be
found, notwithstanding this assertion to the contrary, as eminent in
this particular also, as for the more valuable qualities of composition,
drawing, character, expression, and colouring.</p>

<p>About the same time with this of la Gioconda, he painted the portraits
of a nobleman of Mantua, and of la Ginevra, a daughter of Americus
Benci<a name="FNanchor_LIII._53" id="FNanchor_LIII._53"></a><a href="#Footnote_LIII._53"
class="fnanchor">[i53]</a>, much celebrated for her beauty; and is said to have
finished a picture of Flora some years since remaining at Paris<a name="FNanchor_LIV._54"
id="FNanchor_LIV._54"></a><a href="#Footnote_LIV._54" class="fnanchor">[i54]</a>;
but this last Mariette discovered to be the work of Melzio, from the
circumstance of finding, on a close inspection, the name of this last
master written on it<a name="FNanchor_LV._55" id="FNanchor_LV._55"></a><a href="#Footnote_LV._55"
class="fnanchor">[i55]</a>.</p>

<p>In the year 1503, he was elected by the Florentines to paint their
council-chamber. The subject he chose for this, was the battle against
Attila<a name="FNanchor_LVI._56" id="FNanchor_LVI._56"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_LVI._56" class="fnanchor">[i56]</a>; and he had already made
some progress<span class="pagenum"> <a name="Page_xlii" id="Page_xlii">[Pg xlii]</a>
</span> in his work,
when, to his great mortification, he found his colours peel from the
wall<a name="FNanchor_LVII._57" id="FNanchor_LVII._57"></a><a href="#Footnote_LVII._57"
class="fnanchor">[i57]</a>.</p>

<p>With Leonardo was joined in this undertaking, Michael Angelo, who
painted another side of the room, and who, then a young man of not
more than twenty-nine, had risen to such reputation, as not to fear a
competition with Leonardo, a man of near sixty<a name="FNanchor_LVIII._58"
id="FNanchor_LVIII._58"></a><a href="#Footnote_LVIII._58"
class="fnanchor">[i58]</a>. The productions
of two such able masters placed in the same room, begun at the same
time, and proceeding gradually step by step together, afforded, no
doubt, occasion and opportunity to the admirers and critics in painting
to compare and contrast with each other their respective excellencies
and defects. Had these persons contented themselves simply with
comparing and appreciating the merits of these masters according to
justice and truth, it might perhaps have been advantageous to both,
as directing their attention to the correction of errors; but as each
artist had his admirers, each had also his enemies; the partisans of
the one thinking they did not sufficiently value the merit of their
favourite if they allowed any to his antagonist, or did not, on the
contrary, endeavour to crush by detraction the too formidable reputation
of his adversary. From this conduct was produced<span class="pagenum">
<a name="Page_xliii" id="Page_xliii">[Pg xliii]</a></span> what might easily have
been foreseen; they first became jealous rivals, and at length open and
inveterate enemies<a name="FNanchor_LIX._59" id="FNanchor_LIX._59"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_LIX._59" class="fnanchor">[i59]</a>.</p>

<p>Leonardo&rsquo;s reputation, which had been for many years gradually
increasing, was now so firmly established, that he appears to have been
looked up to as being, what he really was, the reviver and restorer of
the art of painting; and to such an height had the curiosity to view
his works been excited, that Raphael, who was at that time young, and
studying, thought it worth his while to make a journey to Florence in
the month of October 1504<a name="FNanchor_LX._60" id="FNanchor_LX._60"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_LX._60" class="fnanchor">[i60]</a>, on purpose to see them. Nor was his
labour lost, or his time thrown away in so doing; for on first seeing
the works of Leonardo&rsquo;s pencil, he was induced to abandon the dry and
hard manner of his master Perugino&rsquo;s colouring, and to adopt in its
stead the style of Leonardo<a name="FNanchor_LXI._61" id="FNanchor_LXI._61"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_LXI._61" class="fnanchor">[i61]</a>, to which circumstance is owing no
small portion of that esteem in the art, to which Raphael afterwards
very justly arrived.</p>

<p>His father having died in 1504<a name="FNanchor_LXII._62" id="FNanchor_LXII._62"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_LXII._62" class="fnanchor">[i62]</a>, he in consequence of that event
became engaged with his half-brothers, the legitimate sons of Pietro
da Vinci, in a law-suit for the recovery of a share of his father&rsquo;s
property, which in a letter from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xliv"
id="Page_xliv">[Pg xliv]</a></span> Florence to the Governor of Milan, the
date of which does not appear, he speaks of having almost brought to a
conclusion<a name="FNanchor_LXIII._63" id="FNanchor_LXIII._63"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_LXIII._63" class="fnanchor">[i63]</a>. At Florence he
continued from 1503 to 1507<a name="FNanchor_LXIV._64" id="FNanchor_LXIV._64"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_LXIV._64" class="fnanchor">[i64]</a>,
and in the course of that time painted, among other pictures of less
note, a Virgin and Child, once in the hands of the Botti family; and a
Baptist&rsquo;s head, formerly in those of Camillo Albizzi<a name="FNanchor_LXV._65"
id="FNanchor_LXV._65"></a><a href="#Footnote_LXV._65" class="fnanchor">[i65]</a>; but in 1508,
and the succeeding year, he was at Milan, where he received a pension
which had been granted him by Lewis XII.<a name="FNanchor_LXVI._66" id="FNanchor_LXVI._66"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_LXVI._66" class="fnanchor">[i66]</a>; and in the month of
September 1513, he, in company with his scholar Francesco Melzi, quitted
Milan<a name="FNanchor_LXVII._67" id="FNanchor_LXVII._67"></a><a href="#Footnote_LXVII._67"
class="fnanchor">[i67]</a>, and set out for Rome (which till that time he had never
visited), encouraged perhaps to this resolution by the circumstance
that his friend Cardinal John de Medicis, who was afterwards known by
the assumed name of Leo X. had a few months before been advanced to the
papacy<a name="FNanchor_LXVIII._68" id="FNanchor_LXVIII._68"></a><a href="#Footnote_LXVIII._68"
class="fnanchor">[i68]</a>. His known partiality to the arts, and the friendship
which had subsisted between him and Leonardo, held out to the latter
a well-founded expectation of employment for his pencil at Rome, and
we find in this expectation he was not deceived; as, soon after his
arrival, the Pope actually signified his intention of setting him to<span class="pagenum">
<a name="Page_xlv" id="Page_xlv">[Pg xlv]</a></span>
work. Upon this Leonardo began distilling oils for his colours, and
preparing varnishes, which the Pope hearing, said pertly and ignorantly
enough, that he could expect nothing from a man who thought of finishing
his works before he had begun them<a name="FNanchor_LXIX._69" id="FNanchor_LXIX._69"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_LXIX._69" class="fnanchor">[i69]</a>. Had the Pope known, as
he seems not to have done, that oil was the vehicle in which the
colours were to have been worked, or been witness either to the almost
annihilation of the colours in Leonardo&rsquo;s famous picture of the Last
Supper, owing to the damp of the wall, or to the peeling of the colours
from the wall in the council-chamber at Florence, he probably would have
spared this ill-natured reflection. If it applied at all, it could only
be to a very small part of the pursuit in which Leonardo was occupied,
namely, preparing varnish; and if age were necessary to give the varnish
strength, or it were the better for keeping, the answer was in an equal
degree both silly and impertinent; and it is no wonder it should disgust
such a mind as Leonardo&rsquo;s, or produce, as we find it did, such a breach
between the Pope and him, that the intended pictures, whatever they
might have been, were never begun.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xlvi" id="Page_xlvi">[Pg xlvi]</a></span></p>

<p>Disgusted with his treatment at Rome, where the former antipathy between
him and Michael Angelo was again revived by the partisans of each,
he the next year quitted it; and accepting an invitation which had
been made him by Francis the First, he proceeded into France<a name="FNanchor_LXX._70" id="FNanchor_LXX._70"></a><a href="#Footnote_LXX._70" class="fnanchor">[i70]</a>.
At the time of this journey he is said to have been seventy years
old<a name="FNanchor_LXXI._71" id="FNanchor_LXXI._71"></a><a href="#Footnote_LXXI._71" class="fnanchor">[i71]</a>, which cannot be correct, as he did not live to attain that
age in the whole. Probably the singularity of his appearance (for in
his latter years he permitted his beard to grow long), together with
the effect which his intense application to study had produced in his
constitution, might have given rise to an opinion that he was older
than he really was; and indeed it seems pretty clear, that when he
arrived in France he was nearly worn out in body, if not in mind, by the
anxiety and application with which he had pursued his former studies and
investigations.</p>

<p>Although the King&rsquo;s motive to this invitation, which seems to have been
a wish to profit by the pencil of Leonardo, was completely disappointed
by his ill state of health, which the fatigues of his journey and the
change of the climate produced,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xlvii"
id="Page_xlvii">[Pg xlvii]</a></span> so that on his arrival in France no
hopes could be entertained by the King of enriching his collection with
any pictures by Leonardo; yet the French people in general, and the King
in particular, are expressly said to have been as favourable to him as
those of Rome had been injurious, and he was received by the King in the
most affectionate manner. It was however unfortunately too soon evident
that these symptoms of decay were only the forerunners of a more fatal
distemper under which for several months he languished, but which by
degrees was increasing upon him. Of this he was sensible, and therefore
in the beginning of the year 1518, he determined to make his will,
to which he afterwards added one or more codicils. By these he first
describes himself as Leonardo da Vinci, painter to the King, at present
residing at the place called Cloux, near Amboise, and then desires to
be buried in the church of St. Florentine at Amboise, and that his body
should be accompanied from the said place of Cloux to the said church,
by the college of the said church, and the chaplains of St. Dennis of
Amboise, and the friars minor of the said place; and that before his
body is carried to the said church, it should remain three days in the
chamber in which he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xlviii"
id="Page_xlviii">[Pg xlviii]</a></span> should die, or in some other; he further orders
that three great masses and thirty lesser masses of St. Gregory, should
be celebrated there, and a like service be performed in the church of
St. Dennis, and in that of the said friars minor. He gives and bequeaths
to Franco di Melzio, a gentleman of Milan, in return for his services,
all and every the books which he the testator has at present, and other
instruments and drawings respecting his art: To Baptista de Villanis,
his servant, the moiety of the garden which he has without the walls of
Milan; and the other moiety of the said garden to Salay his servant. He
gives to the said Francesco Meltio the arrears of his pension, and the
sum of money owing to him at present, and at the time of his death, by
the treasurer M. Johan Sapin; and to the same person all and singular
his clothes and vestments. He orders and wills, that the sum of four
hundred crowns of the sum which he has in the hands of the chamberlain
of Santa Maria Nuova, at Florence, should be given to his brethren
residing at Florence, with the profit and emolument thereon. And
lastly, he appoints the said Gia. Francesco de Meltio, whole and sole
executor<a name="FNanchor_LXXII._72" id="FNanchor_LXXII._72"></a><a href="#Footnote_LXXII._72" class="fnanchor">[i72]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xlix" id="Page_xlix">[Pg xlix]</a></span></p>

<p>This Will bears date, and appears to have been executed on the 23d of
April 1518. He however survived the making of it more than a year; and
on the 23d of April 1519<a name="FNanchor_LXXIII._73" id="FNanchor_LXXIII._73"></a><a href="#Footnote_LXXIII._73" class="fnanchor">[i73]</a>, the day twelvemonth on which it had
been originally made, he, though it does not appear for what reason,
re-executed it; and the next day added a codicil, by which he gave to
his servant, Gio. Battista de Villanis, the right which had been granted
him in return for his labours on the canal of Martesana, of exacting a
certain portion of all the wood transported on the Ticino<a name="FNanchor_LXXIV._74" id="FNanchor_LXXIV._74"></a><a href="#Footnote_LXXIV._74" class="fnanchor">[i74]</a>.</p>

<p>All this interval of time between the making and re-execution of his
will, and indeed the whole period from his arrival in France, he seems
to have been struggling under an incurable illness. The King frequently
during its continuance honoured him with visits; and it has been said,
that in one of these Leonardo exerting himself beyond his strength,
to shew his sense of this prince&rsquo;s condescension, was seized with
a fainting fit, and that the King stooping forward to support him,
Leonardo expired in his arms, on the 2d of May 1519<a name="FNanchor_LXXV._75"
id="FNanchor_LXXV._75"></a><a href="#Footnote_LXXV._75" class="fnanchor">[i75]</a>. Venturi has
taken some pains to disprove this fact, by shewing<a name="FNanchor_LXXVI._76"
id="FNanchor_LXXVI._76"></a><a href="#Footnote_LXXVI._76"
class="fnanchor">[i76]</a>,<span class="pagenum">
<a name="Page_l" id="Page_l">[Pg l]</a></span> that though
in the interval between the years 1516 and 1519, the French court passed
eleven months at different times at Amboise; yet on the 1st of May
1519, it was certainly not here, but at St. Germains. History, however,
when incorrect, is more frequently a mixture of true and false, than a
total fabrication of falsehood; and it is therefore not impossible, or
improbable, that the King might shew such an act of kindness in some
of his visits when he was resident at Amboise, and that Leonardo might
recover from that fit, and not die till some time after; at which latter
time the Court and the King might be absent at St. Germains. This is
surely a more rational supposition than to imagine such a fact could
have been invented without any foundation for it whatever.</p>

<p>It is impossible within the limits that can here be allowed, to do any
thing like justice to the merits of this extraordinary man: all that
can in this place be effected is to give the principal facts respecting
him; and this is all, therefore, that has been attempted. A sufficient
account, however, at least for the present purpose, it is presumed has
been given above of the Author, and the productions of his pencil, and
it now remains therefore only to speak of those of his pen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_li" id="Page_li">[Pg li]</a></span></p>

<p>With what view the Author engaged in this arduous course of study,
how eager he was in the pursuit of knowledge, how anxious to avail
himself of the best means of obtaining complete information on every
subject to which he applied, and how careful to minute down whatever he
procured that could be useful, have been already shewn in the course
of the foregoing narrative; but in order to prevent the necessity of
interrupting there the succession of events, it has been reserved for
this place to describe the contents and extent of his collections, and
to give a brief idea of the branches to which they relate.</p>

<p>On inquiry then we learn, that Leonardo&rsquo;s productions of this kind
consist of fourteen manuscript volumes, large and small, now in the
library of the National Institute at Paris, whither they have been some
few years since removed from the Ambrosian library at Milan; and of
one folio volume in manuscript also, in the possession of his Majesty
the King of Great Britain. Of those at Paris, J. B. Venturi, Professor
of Natural Philosophy at Modena, and of the Institute of Bologna, &amp;c.
who was permitted to inspect them, says<a name="FNanchor_LXXVII._77" id="FNanchor_LXXVII._77"></a><a href="#Footnote_LXXVII._77" class="fnanchor">[i77]</a>, that &ldquo;they contain
speculations in those branches of natural philosophy<span class="pagenum">
<a name="Page_lii" id="Page_lii">[Pg lii]</a></span> nearest allied to
geometry; that they are first sketches and occasional notes, the Author
always intending afterwards to compose from them complete treatises.&rdquo;
He adds further, &ldquo;that they are written backwards from right to left,
in the manner of the oriental writers, probably with intention that the
curious should not rob him of his discoveries. The spirit of geometry
guided him throughout, whether it were in the art of analysing a subject
in the connexion of the discourse, or the care of always generalizing
his ideas. As to natural philosophy, he never was satisfied on any
proposition if he had not proved it by experiment.&rdquo; From the extracts
given from these manuscripts by Venturi himself, and which he has ranged
under the different heads mentioned in the note<a name="FNanchor_LXXVIII._78" id="FNanchor_LXXVIII._78"></a><a href="#Footnote_LXXVIII._78" class="fnanchor">[i78]</a>, the contents
of these volumes appear to be extremely miscellaneous; and it is
evident, as Venturi has marked by references where each extract is to be
found in the original, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_liii"
id="Page_liii">[Pg liii]</a></span> from the great distance at which passages
on the same subject are placed from each other, they must have been
entered without any regard to method or arrangement of any kind whatever.</p>

<p>The volume in the possession of his Britannic Majesty is described as
consisting &ldquo;of a variety of elegant heads, some of which are drawn
with red and black chalks on blue or red paper, others with a metal
pencil on a tinted paper; a few of them are washed and heightened with
white, and many are on common paper. The subjects of these drawings
are miscellaneous, as portraits, caricatures, single figures, tilting,
horses, and other animals; botany, optics, perspective, gunnery,
hydraulics, mechanics, and a great number of anatomical subjects, which
are drawn with a more spirited pen, and illustrated with a variety of
manuscript notes. This volume contains what is of more importance, the
very characteristic head of Leonardo, as it was sketched by himself, and
now engraved by that eminent artist Mr. Bartolozzi<a name="FNanchor_LXXIX._79"
id="FNanchor_LXXIX._79"></a><a href="#Footnote_LXXIX._79" class="fnanchor">[i79]</a>.&rdquo; Specimens
from this volume have been published some years since by Mr. Dalton, and
more recently and accurately by Mr. Chamberlaine; and though it must
be confessed, that the former are extremely ill<span class="pagenum">
<a name="Page_liv" id="Page_liv">[Pg liv]</a></span> drawn, and betray the
grossest ignorance of the effect which light and shadow were intended
to produce, yet some of the subjects which the volume contains may be
ascertained by them; and among them is also a fac simile of a page of
the original manuscript, which proves this, like the other volumes, to
be in Italian, and written backwards. The latter is a very beautiful
work, and is calculated to give an accurate idea of Leonardo&rsquo;s talents
as a draughtsman<a name="FNanchor_LXXX._80" id="FNanchor_LXXX._80"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_LXXX._80" class="fnanchor">[i80]</a>. From these two
publications it appears, that
this volume also is of a very miscellaneous nature, and that it consists
of manuscript entries, interspersed with finished drawings of heads
and figures, and slight sketches of mechanical engines and anatomical
subjects, some of which are intermixed with the writing itself.</p>

<p>It has been already seen, that these volumes were originally given by
the will of Leonardo to Francisco Melzi; and their subsequent history we
are enabled to state on the authority of John Ambrose Mazenta, through
whose hands they passed. Du Fresne, in the life prefixed to the edition
which he published in Italian, of Leonardo da Vinci&rsquo;s Treatise on
Painting, has, in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lv" id="Page_lv">[Pg lv]</a>
</span> very loose way, and without citing any authority,
given their history; but Venturi has inserted<a name="FNanchor_LXXXI._81"
id="FNanchor_LXXXI._81"></a><a href="#Footnote_LXXXI._81"
class="fnanchor">[i81]</a> a translation into
French, from the original manuscript memoir of Mazenta; and from him a
version of it into English is here given, with the addition of Venturi&rsquo;s
notes, rendered also into English.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is near fifty years<a name="FNanchor_LXXXII._82" id="FNanchor_LXXXII._82"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_LXXXII._82" class="fnanchor">[i82]</a> since there fell into my hands thirteen
volumes of Leonardo da Vinci in folio and quarto, written backwards.
Accident brought them to me in the following manner: I was residing
at Pisa, for the purpose of studying the law, in the family of Aldus
Manutius the younger, a great lover of books. A person named Lelio
Gavardi, of Asola, Prevost of S. Zeno, at Pavia, a very near relation of
Aldus, came to our house; he had been a teacher of the <i>belles lettres</i>
in the family of the Melzi of Milan, called de Vavero, to distinguish
them from other families of the same name in that city. He had, at their
country house at Vavero, met with several drawings, instruments, and<span class="pagenum">
<a name="Page_lvi" id="Page_lvi">[Pg lvi]</a></span>
books of Leonardo. Francisco Melzi<a name="FNanchor_LXXXIII._83" id="FNanchor_LXXXIII._83"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_LXXXIII._83" class="fnanchor">[i83]</a> approached nearer than
any one to the manner of De Vinci; he worked little, because he was
rich; his pictures are very much finished, they are often confounded
with those of his master. At his death he left the works of Leonardo
in his house at Vavero, to his sons, who having tastes and pursuits of
a different kind, neglected these treasures, and soon dispersed them;
Lelio Gavardi possessed himself of as many of them as he pleased; he
carried thirteen volumes to Florence, in hopes of receiving for them
a good price from the Grand Duke Francis, who was eager after works
of this sort; and the rather as Leonardo was in great reputation in
his own country. But this prince died<a name="FNanchor_LXXXIV._84" id="FNanchor_LXXXIV._84"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_LXXXIV._84" class="fnanchor">[i84]</a> as soon as Gavardi was
arrived at Florence. He then went to Pisa, to the house of Manutius. I
could not approve his proceeding; it was scandalous. My studies being
finished, I had occasion to return to Milan. He gave me the volumes
of Vinci, desiring me to return them to the Melzi: I acquitted myself
faithfully of my commission; I carried them all back to Horatio, the
chief of the family of Melzi, who was surprised<span class="pagenum">
<a name="Page_lvii" id="Page_lvii">[Pg lvii]</a></span> at my being willing to
give myself this trouble. He made me a present of these books, telling
me he had still many drawings by the same author, long neglected in
the garrets of his house in the country. Thus these books became my
property, and afterwards they belonged to my brothers<a name="FNanchor_LXXXV._85" id="FNanchor_LXXXV._85"></a><a href="#Footnote_LXXXV._85" class="fnanchor">[i85]</a>. These
latter having made too much parade of this acquisition, and the ease
with which I was brought to it, excited the envy of other amateurs,
who beset Horatio, and obtained from him some drawings, some figures,
some anatomical pieces, and other valuable remains of the cabinet of
Leonardo. One of these spungers for the works of Leonardo, was Pompeo
Aretin, son of the Cavalier Leoni, formerly a disciple of Bonaroti, and
who was about Philip II. King of Spain, for whom he did all the bronzes
which are at the Escurial. Pompeo engaged himself to procure for Melzi
an employment to the senate of Milan, if he succeeded in recovering
the thirteen books, wishing to offer them to King Philip, a lover of
such curiosities. Flattered with this hope, Melzi went to my brother&rsquo;s
house: he besought him on his knees to restore him his present; he
was a fellow-collegian, a friend, a benefactor: seven volumes<span class="pagenum">
<a name="Page_lviii" id="Page_lviii">[Pg lviii]</a></span> were
returned to him<a name="FNanchor_LXXXVI._86" id="FNanchor_LXXXVI._86"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_LXXXVI._86" class="fnanchor">[i86]</a>. Of the six
others which remained to the
Mazenta family, one was presented to Cardinal Frederic Borromeo, for the
Ambrosian library<a name="FNanchor_LXXXVII._87" id="FNanchor_LXXXVII._87"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_LXXXVII._87" class="fnanchor">[i87]</a>. My brother gave a
second to Ambrose Figini,
a celebrated painter of his time, who left it to his heir Hercole
Bianchi, with the rest of his cabinet. Urged by the Duke of Savoy, I
procured for him a third; and in conclusion, my brother having died at
a distance from Milan<a name="FNanchor_LXXXVIII._88" id="FNanchor_LXXXVIII._88"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_LXXXVIII._88" class="fnanchor">[i88]</a>, the three
remaining volumes came also
into the hands of Pompeo Aretin; he re-assembled also others of them,
he separated the leaves of them to form a thick volume<a name="FNanchor_LXXXIX._89"
id="FNanchor_LXXXIX._89"></a><a href="#Footnote_LXXXIX._89" class="fnanchor">[i89]</a>, which
passed to his heir Polidoro Calchi, and was afterwards sold to Galeazzo
Arconati. This gentleman keeps it now in his rich library; he has
refused it to the Duke of Savoy, and to other princes who were desirous
of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lix" id="Page_lix">[Pg lix]</a></span></p>

<p>In addition to this memoir, Venturi notices<a name="FNanchor_XC._90" id="FNanchor_XC._90"></a><a href="#Footnote_XC._90" class="fnanchor">[i90]</a>, that Howard Earl
of Arundel made ineffectual efforts to obtain this large volume, and
offered for it as far as 60,000 francs, in the name of the King of
England. Arconati would never part with it; he bought eleven other books
of Da Vinci, which came also, according to appearance, from Leoni; in
1637 he made a gift of them all to the Ambrosian library<a name="FNanchor_XCI._91" id="FNanchor_XCI._91"></a><a href="#Footnote_XCI._91" class="fnanchor">[i91]</a>, which
already was in possession of the volume E, from Mazenta, and received
afterwards the volume K from Horatio Archinto, in 1674<a name="FNanchor_XCII._92" id="FNanchor_XCII._92"></a><a href="#Footnote_XCII._92" class="fnanchor">[i92]</a>.</p>

<p>Venturi says, this is the history of all the manuscripts of Vinci that
are come into France; they are in number fourteen, because the volume
B contains an appendix of eighteen leaves, which may be separated, and
considered as the fourteenth volume<a name="FNanchor_XCIII._93" id="FNanchor_XCIII._93"></a><a href="#Footnote_XCIII._93" class="fnanchor">[i93]</a>.</p>

<p>In the printed catalogue of the library of Turin, one does not see
noticed the manuscript which Mazenta gave to the Duke of Savoy: it has
then disappeared. Might it not be that which an Englishman got copied by
Francis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lx" id="Page_lx">[Pg lx]</a>
</span> Ducci, library-keeper at Florence, and a copy of which is still
remaining in the same city<a name="FNanchor_XCIV._94" id="FNanchor_XCIV._94"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_XCIV._94" class="fnanchor">[i94]</a>?</p>

<p>The Trivulce family at Milan, according to Venturi<a name="FNanchor_XCV._95"
id="FNanchor_XCV._95"></a><a href="#Footnote_XCV._95" class="fnanchor">[i95]</a>, possess also a
manuscript of Vinci, which is in great part only a vocabulary.</p>

<p>Of the volume in the possession of his Britannic Majesty, the following
account is given in the life of Leonardo, prefixed to that number
already published from it by Mr. Chamberlaine: &ldquo;It was one of the three
volumes which became the property of Pompeo Leoni, that is now in his
Majesty&rsquo;s cabinet. It is rather probable than certain, that this great
curiosity was acquired for King Charles I. by the Earl of Arundel, when
he went Ambassador to the Emperor Ferdinand II. in 1636, as may indeed
be inferred from an instructive inscription over the place where the
volumes are kept, which sets forth, that James King of England offered
three thousand pistoles for one of the volumes of Leonardo&rsquo;s works. And
some documents in the Ambrosian library give colour to this conjecture.
This volume was happily preserved during the civil wars of the last
century among other specimens of the fine arts, which the munificence
of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxi" id="Page_lxi">[Pg lxi]</a>
</span> Charles I. had amassed with a diligence equal to his taste. And it
was discovered soon after his present Majesty&rsquo;s accession in the same
cabinet where Queen Caroline found the fine portraits of the court of
Henry VIII. by Hans Holbein, which the King&rsquo;s liberality permitted me
lately to lay before the public. On the cover of this volume is written,
in gold letters, what ascertains its descent; <i>Disegni di Leonardo da
Vinci, restaurati da Pompeo Leoni</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Although no part of the collections of Leonardo was arranged and
prepared by himself, or others under his direction, for publication,
some extracts have been made from his writings, and given to the world
as separate tracts. The best known, and indeed the principal of these,
is the following Treatise on Painting, of which there will be occasion
to say more presently; but besides this, Edward Cooper, a London
bookseller, about the year 1720, published a fragment of a Treatise by
Leonardo da Vinci, on the Motions of the Human Body, and the Manner of
drawing Figures, according to geometrical Rules. It contains but ten
plates in folio, including the title-page, and was evidently extracted
from some of the volumes of his collections, as it consists of slight
sketches and verbal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxii" id="Page_lxii">[Pg lxii]</a>
</span> descriptions both in Italian and English, to
explain such of them as needed it.</p>

<p>Mr. Dalton, as has been before noticed, several years since published
some engravings from the volume in our King&rsquo;s collection, but they are
so badly done as to be of no value. Mr. Chamberlaine therefore, in 1796,
took up the intention afresh, and in that year his first number came
out, which is all that has yet appeared.</p>

<p>Of the Treatise on Painting, Venturi<a name="FNanchor_XCVI._96" id="FNanchor_XCVI._96"></a><a href="#Footnote_XCVI._96" class="fnanchor">[i96]</a> gives the following
particulars: &ldquo;The Treatise on Painting which we have of Vinci is only
a compilation of different fragments extracted from his manuscripts.
It was in the Barberini library at Rome, in 1630<a name="FNanchor_XCVII._97" id="FNanchor_XCVII._97"></a><a href="#Footnote_XCVII._97" class="fnanchor">[i97]</a>: the Cav. del
Pozzo obtained a copy from it, and Poussin designed the figures of it
in 1640<a name="FNanchor_XCVIII._98" id="FNanchor_XCVIII._98"></a><a href="#Footnote_XCVIII._98" class="fnanchor">[i98]</a>. This copy, and another derived from the same source,
in the possession of Thevenot, served as the basis for the edition
published in 1651, by Raphael du Fr√™ne. The manuscript of Pozzo, with
the figures of Poussin, is actually at Paris, in the valuable collection
of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxiii" id="Page_lxiii">[Pg lxiii]</a>
</span> books of Chardin<a name="FNanchor_XCIX._99" id="FNanchor_XCIX._99"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_XCIX._99" class="fnanchor">[i99]</a>. It is from this that I have taken the
relation of Mazenta; it is at the end of the manuscript under this
title: &ldquo;Some Notices of the Works of Leonardo da Vinci at Milan, and of
his Books, by J. Ambrose Mazenta of Milan, of the Congregation of the
Priests Regular of St. Paul, called the Barnabites.&rdquo; Mazenta does not
announce himself as the author of the compilation; he may however be so;
it may also happen, that the compilation was made by the heir himself of
Vinci, Francisco Melzo. Vasari, about 1567, says<a name="FNanchor_C._100" id="FNanchor_C._100"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_C._100" class="fnanchor">[i100]</a>, that a painter of
Milan had the manuscripts of Vinci, which were written backwards; that
this painter came to him, and afterwards went to Rome, with intention to
get them printed, but that he did not know what was the result. However
it may be, Du Fr√™ne confesses that this compilation is imperfect in
many respects, and ill arranged. It is so, because the compiler has not
seized the methodical spirit of Vinci, and that there are mixed with it
some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxiv" id="Page_lxiv">[Pg lxiv]</a>
</span> pieces which belong to other tracts; besides, one has not seen
where many other chapters have been neglected which ought to make part
of it. For example, the comparison of painting with sculpture, which has
been announced as a separate treatise of the same author, is nothing
more than a chapter belonging to the Treatise on Painting, A. 105. All
this will be complete, and put in order, in the Treatise on Optics<a name="FNanchor_CI._101"
id="FNanchor_CI._101"></a><a href="#Footnote_CI._101" class="fnanchor">[i101]</a>.
In the mean time, however, the following are the different editions of
this compilation, such as it is at present:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Trattato della Pittura di Leonardo da Vinci, nuovamente dato in Luce,
con la Vita dell&rsquo; Autore da Raphaele du Fr√™ne, Parigi 1651, in fol.;
reprinted at Naples in 1733, in folio; at Bologna, in 1786, in folio; at
Florence, in 1792, in 4to. This last edition has been given from a copy
in the hand-writing of Stephano della Bella.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&mdash;&mdash;Translated into French by Roland Freart de Chambray, Paris 1651,
fol. reprinted ibid. 1716, in 12mo, and 1796, in 8vo.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&mdash;&mdash;Translated into German, in 4to. Nuremberg 1786, Weigel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&mdash;&mdash;Translated into Greek by Panagiotto, manuscript in the Nani library
at Venice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxv" id="Page_lxv">[Pg lxv]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Another manuscript copy of this compilation was in the possession of P.
Orlandi, from whence it passed into the library of Smith<a name="FNanchor_CII._102" id="FNanchor_CII._102"></a><a href="#Footnote_CII._102" class="fnanchor">[i102]</a>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cellini, in a discourse published by Morelli, says<a name="FNanchor_CIII._103" id="FNanchor_CIII._103"></a><a href="#Footnote_CIII._103" class="fnanchor">[i103]</a>, that
he possessed a copy of a book of De Vinci on Perspective, which he
communicated to Serlio, and that this latter published from it all that
he could comprehend. Might not this be the tract which Gori announces to
be in the library of the Academy of Cortona<a name="FNanchor_CIV._104" id="FNanchor_CIV._104"></a><a href="#Footnote_CIV._104" class="fnanchor">[i104]</a>?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The reputation in which the Treatise on Painting ought to be held,
is not now for the first time to be settled; its merit has been
acknowledged by the best judges, though at that time it laboured under
great disadvantage from the want of a proper arrangement. In the
present publication that objection is removed, and the attempt has
been favourable to the work itself, as it has shewn it, by bringing
together the several chapters that related to each other, to be a
much more complete and connected treatise than was before supposed.
Notwithstanding however the fair estimation in which it has always
stood, and which is no more than its due, one person has been found
hardy enough to endeavour, though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxvi"
id="Page_lxvi">[Pg lxvi]</a></span> unsuccessfully, to lessen its credit:
a circumstance which it would not have been worth while to notice, if
it had not been intimated to us, that there are still some persons
in France who side with the objector, which, as he was a Frenchman,
and Leonardo an Italian, may perhaps be ascribed, in some measure at
least, to the desire which in several instances that people have lately
shewn of claiming on behalf of their countrymen, a preference over
others, to which they are not entitled. Abraham Bosse, of the city of
Tours, an engraver in copper, who lived in the last century, is the
person here alluded to; and it may not be impertinent in this place to
state some of the motives by which he was induced to such a conduct.
At the time when this Treatise first made its appearance in France,
as well in Italian as in French, Bosse appears to have been resident
at Paris, and was a member of the Academy of Painting, where he gave
the first lessons on perspective, and, with the assistance of Mons.
Desargues, published from time to time several tracts on geometry and
perspective, the manner of designing, and the art of engraving, some
of which at least are described in the title-page, as printed at Paris
for the author<a name="FNanchor_CV._105" id="FNanchor_CV._105"></a><a href="#Footnote_CV._105"
class="fnanchor">[i105]</a>. This man,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxvii"
id="Page_lxvii">[Pg lxvii]</a></span> in his lectures, having, it is said,
attacked some of the pictures painted by Le Brun, the then Director of
the Academy, had been very deservedly removed from his situation, and
forced to quit the Academy, for endeavouring to lessen that authority,
which for the instruction and improvement of students it was necessary
the Director should possess, and attempting thus to render fruitless the
precepts which his situation required him to deliver. As this Treatise
of Leonardo had in the translation been adopted by Le Brun, who fully
saw its value, and introduced it into the Academy for the advantage of
the students, by which means the sale of Bosse&rsquo;s work might be, and
probably was, affected; Bosse, at the end of a Treatise on Geometry and
Perspective, taught in the Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture,
published by him in octavo in 1665, has inserted a paper with this
title, which in the original is given in French, but we have preferred
translating it: &ldquo;<i>What follows is for those who shall have the curiosity
to be acquainted with a part of the procedings of Mons. Desargues,
and myself, against some of our antagonists, and part of their skill;
together with some remarks made on the contents of several chapters of a
Treatise attributed to Leonardo de Vinci, translated from Italian into
French by</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxviii" id="Page_lxviii">[Pg lxviii]</a>
</span><i> Mons. Freart Sieur de Chambray, from a manuscript taken from
that which is in the library of the illustrious, virtuous, and curious
Mons. le Chevalier Du Puis at Rome</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After the explanation of his motives above given, it is not wonderful
to find him asserting, that this Treatise of Leonardo was in a number
of circumstances inferior to his own; nor to observe, that in a list of
some of the chapters which he has there given, we should be frequently
told by him that they are false, absurd, ridiculous, confused,
trifling, weak, and, in short, every thing but good. It is true that
the estimation of Leonardo da Vinci was in France too high for him to
attack without risking his own character for judgment and taste, and
he has therefore found it necessary for his purpose insidiously to
suggest that these chapters were interpolations; but of this he has
produced no proof, which, had it been the fact, might have been easily
obtained, by only getting some friend to consult Leonardo&rsquo;s manuscript
collections in the Ambrosian library. That he would have taken this step
if he had expected any success from it, may fairly be inferred from the
circumstance of his writing to Poussin at Rome, apparently in hopes of
inducing him to say something to the disadvantage of the work; and his
omitting to make this inquiry after the enmity he has shewn against the
book, fully justifies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxix" id="Page_lxix">[Pg lxix]</a>
</span> an opinion that he forbore to inquire, because
he was conscious that such an investigation would have terminated in
vindicating his adversaries from his aspersions, and have furnished
evidence of their fidelity and accuracy.</p>

<p>What the letter which he wrote to Poussin contained, he has not informed
us; but he has given us, as he says, Poussin&rsquo;s answer<a name="FNanchor_CVI._106"
id="FNanchor_CVI._106"></a><a href="#Footnote_CVI._106" class="fnanchor">[i106]</a>, in which
are some passages relating to this Treatise, of which we here give a
translation: &ldquo;As to what concerns the book of Leonard Vinci, it is true
that I have designed the human figures which are in that which Mons.
le Chevalier du Puis has; but all the others, whether geometrical or
otherwise, are of one man, named Gli Alberti, the very same who has
drawn the plants which are in the book of subterraneous Rome; and the
awkward landscapes which are behind some of the little human figures of
the copy which Mons. du Chambray has caused to be printed, have been
added to it by one Errard, without my knowing any thing of it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All that is good in this book may be written on one sheet of paper, in
a large character, and those who believe that I approve all that is in
it, do not know me; I who profess never to give sanction to things of my
profession which I know to be ill done and ill said.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxx" id="Page_lxx">[Pg lxx]</a></span></p>

<p>Whoever recollects the difference in the course of study pursued and
recommended by Leonardo (that of Nature), from that observed by Poussin
(that of the antique), and remembers also the different fortunes of
Le Brun and Poussin, that the one was at the head of his profession,
enjoying all its honours and emoluments, while the other, though
conscious of his own great powers, was toiling for a daily subsistence
in comparative obscurity, may easily conceive why the latter could not
approve a work which so strongly inculcates the adopting Nature as the
guide throughout; and which was at the same time patronized by one whom
he could not but consider as his more fortunate rival. It may however
be truly affirmed, that even the talents of Poussin, great as they
certainly were, and his knowledge and correctness in drawing, would have
been abundantly improved by an attention to the rules laid down in this
Treatise, and that the study of Nature would have freed his pictures
from that resemblance to statues which his figures frequently have, and
bestowed on them the soft and fleshy appearance for which Leonardo was
so remarkable; while a minute investigation of Leonardo&rsquo;s system of
colouring would have produced perhaps in him as fortunate a change as we
have seen it did in the case of Raphael.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxxi" id="Page_lxxi">[Pg lxxi]</a></span></p>

<p>Though Bosse tells us<a name="FNanchor_CVII._107" id="FNanchor_CVII._107"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_CVII._107" class="fnanchor">[i107]</a>, that he had seen in the hands of Mons.
Felibien, a manuscript copy of this Tract on Painting, which he said
he had taken from the same original mentioned before, for the purpose
of translating it into French; and that on Bosse&rsquo;s pointing out to him
some of these errors, and informing him that Mons. de Chambray was far
advanced in his translation, he abandoned his design, and assigned to
the Sieur de Chambray the privilege he had obtained for it; we have
no intention here to enumerate or answer Bosse&rsquo;s objections, merely
because such an undertaking would greatly exceed the limits which can
here be allowed us. Most of them will be found captious and splenetic,
and, together with the majority of the rest, might be fully refuted by
a deduction of facts; it is however sufficient on the present occasion
to say, that wherever opportunity has been afforded of tracing the means
by which Leonardo procured his materials for any great composition,
he is found to have exactly pursued the path which he recommends to
others<a name="FNanchor_CVIII._108" id="FNanchor_CVIII._108"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_CVIII._108" class="fnanchor">[i108]</a>; and for the
success of his precepts,<span class="pagenum"> <a name="Page_lxxii" id="Page_lxxii">[Pg lxxii]</a>
</span> and what may be
effected by them, we need only appeal to his own example.</p>

<p>To this enumeration of the productions of Leonardo&rsquo;s pen, and in
contradiction to the fact already asserted, that no part of his
collections was ever arranged or prepared for publication by himself,
it is probable we may be told we should add tracts on Motion; on the
Equilibrium of bodies; on the nature, equilibrium, and motion of Water;
on Anatomy; on the Anatomy of an horse; on Perspective; and on Light
and Shadow: which are either mentioned by himself in the Treatise on
Painting, or ascribed to him by others. But as to these, there is great
reason for supposing, that, though they might be intended, they were
never actually drawn up into form. Certain it is, that no such have
been ever given to the world, as those before noticed are the only
treatises of this author that have yet appeared in print; and even they
have already been shewn to be no more than extracts from the immense
mass of his collections of such passages as related to the subjects on
which they profess to give intelligence. If any tracts therefore in his
name, on any of the above topics, are any where existing<span class="pagenum">
<a name="Page_lxxiii" id="Page_lxxiii">[Pg lxxiii]</a></span> in manuscript,
and in obscurity, it is probable they are only similar selections. And
indeed it will be found on inspection, that his collections consist
of a multitude of entries made at different times, without method,
order, or arrangement of any kind, so as to form an immense chaos of
intelligence, which he, like many other voluminous collectors, intended
at some future time to digest and arrange, but unfortunately postponed
this task so long, that he did not live to carry that intention into
effect. Under these circumstances, should it happen, as perhaps it
may, that any volume of the whole is confined exclusively to any one
branch of science, such as hydrostatics for instance, it was not the
consequence of a designed plan, but only arose from this accident, that
he had then made that branch the object of his pursuit, and for a time
laid aside the rest. In proof of this assertion it may be observed, that
the very treatise of light and shadow above mentioned, is described as
in the Ambrosian library at Milan, and as a folio volume covered with
red velvet, presented by Signior Mazzenta to Cardinal Borromeo<a name="FNanchor_CIX._109"
id="FNanchor_CIX._109"></a><a href="#Footnote_CIX._109" class="fnanchor">[i109]</a>;
from all which circumstances it is evidently proved to be<span class="pagenum">
<a name="Page_lxxiv" id="Page_lxxiv">[Pg lxxiv]</a></span> one of the
volumes now existing in France<a name="FNanchor_CX._110" id="FNanchor_CX._110"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_CX._110" class="fnanchor">[i110]</a>, which were inspected and described
by Venturi in the tract so often cited in the course of this life.</p>

<p>Although the principal of Leonardo&rsquo;s productions have been already
mentioned, it has been thought proper, for the satisfaction of the
curious, here to subjoin a catalogue of such of them as have come to our
knowledge; distinguishing in it such as were only drawings, from such
as were finished pictures, and noticing also which of them have been
engraven, and by whom.</p>

<p><i>A model in clay</i>, in alto relievo. It is a circle of about two palms in
diameter, and represents St. Jerom in a grotto, old, and much worn out
by prayer. It was in the possession of Sig. Ignazio Hugford, a painter
at Florence, who was induced to buy it in consequence of the great
praises which in his youth he had heard bestowed on it by the celebrated
Anton. Dominico Gabbiani, his master, who knew it to be of the hand of
Leonardo. This model appears to have been much studied in the time of
Pontormo and Rosso; and many copies of it, both drawings and pictures,
are to be found throughout Florence, well painted in their manner<a name="FNanchor_CXVII_117"

<p class="top2 s3 center bottom1">DRAWINGS.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vasari</span>, p. 24, says, that it was Leonardo&rsquo;s practice to model
figures from the life, and then to cover them with fine thin lawn or
cambric, so as to be able to see through it, and with the point of a
fine pencil to trace off the outlines in black and white; and that some
such drawings he had in his collection.</p>

<p><i>A head in chiaro oscuro</i>, in the possession of Vasari, and mentioned by
him as divine, a drawing on paper<a name="FNanchor_CXIX_119" id="FNanchor_CXIX_119">
</a><a href="#Footnote_CXIX_119" class="fnanchor">[i119]</a>.</p>

<p><i>A carton of Adam and Eve in Paradise</i>, made by him for the King of
Portugal. It is done with a pen in chiaro oscuro, and heightened with
white, and was intended to be worked as tapestry in silk and gold; but
Vasari says it was never executed, and that in his time the carton
remained at Florence, in the house of Ottaviano de Medici. Whether this
carton is still existing is unknown<a name="FNanchor_CXX_120" id="FNanchor_CXX_120">
</a><a href="#Footnote_CXX_120" class="fnanchor">[i120]</a>.</p>

<p><i>Several ridiculous heads of men and women</i>, formerly in Vasari&rsquo;s
collection, drawn in pen and ink<a name="FNanchor_CXXI_121" id="FNanchor_CXXI_121">
</a><a href="#Footnote_CXXI_121" class="fnanchor">[i121]</a>. Aurelio Lovino had, says Lomazzo,
a book of sketches by Leonardo, of odd and ridiculous heads. This
book appears to have contained about 250 figures of countrymen and
countrywomen laughing,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxxviii"
id="Page_lxxviii">[Pg lxxviii]</a></span> drawn by the hand of Leonardo. Card. Silvio
Valenti had a similar book, in which were caricature heads drawn with a
pen, like that engraven by Count Caylus. Of these caricatures mention
is made in the second volume of the Lettere Pittoriche, p. 170<a name="FNanchor_CXXII_122"
id="FNanchor_CXXII_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_CXXII_122" class="fnanchor">[i122]</a>. The
passage in the Lettere Pittoriche here referred to, is part of a letter
without any name or date, addressed <i>Al Sig. C. di C.</i>; but a note of
the editor&rsquo;s explains these initials, as meaning Sig. Conte di Caylus,
and supposes the author to have been the younger Mariette. The letter
mentions a collection of heads from Leonardo&rsquo;s drawings, published by
the Count; and the editor, in another note, tells us, that they are
caricature heads drawn in pen and ink; that the originals were bought in
Holland, from Sig. Cardin. Silvio Valenti, and that the prints of which
the letter speaks, are in the famous collection of the Corsini library.
The author of the Letter supposes these caricatures to have been drawn
when Vinci retired to Melzi&rsquo;s house, that he invented them as a new sort
of recreation, and intended them as a subject for the academy which he
had established at Milan.</p>

<p>In another part of the same Letter, p. 173, 174, this collection of
drawings of heads is again mentioned, and it is there said, that it
might be that which belonged to the Earl of Arundel. This conjecture is
founded on there being many such heads<span class="pagenum">
<a name="Page_lxxix" id="Page_lxxix">[Pg lxxix]</a></span> engraven formerly by Hollar.
In fact, the number of the plates which he has done from drawings of
this painter, are near one hundred, which compose different series. The
author of the Letter adds, that, if a conjecture might be permitted,
we might affirm, that this is the collection of heads of which Paul
Lomazzo speaks; at least the description which he gives of a similar
collection which was in the hands of Aurelio Lovino, a painter of Milan,
corresponds with this as well in the number of the drawings as their
subjects. It represents, like this, studies from old men, countrymen,
wrinkled old women, which are all laughing. Another part of this Letter
says, it is easy to believe that the collection of drawings of heads
which occasioned this Letter, might be one of those books in which
Leonardo noted the most singular countenances.</p>

<p>In p. 198 of the same Letter, Hollar&rsquo;s engravings are said to be about
an hundred, and to have been done at Antwerp in 1645, and the following
year; and in p. 199, Count Caylus&rsquo;s publication is said to contain 59
plates in aqua fortis, done in 1730, and that this latter is the work so
often mentioned in the Letter.</p>

<p><i>Another collection of the same kind of caricature heads</i> mentioned in
Mariette&rsquo;s Letter<a name="FNanchor_CXXIII_123" id="FNanchor_CXXIII_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_CXXIII_123"
class="fnanchor">[i123]</a>, as existing in the cabinet of either the King of
Spain or the King of Sardinia.</p>

<p><i>Four caricature heads</i>, mentioned, Lett. Pitt. vol. ii. p. 190, as
being in the possession of Sig. Crozat. They are described as drawn with
a pen, and are said to have come originally from Vasari&rsquo;s collection of
drawings. Of this collection it is said, in a note on the above passage,
that it was afterwards carried into France, and fell into the hands of a
bookseller, who took the volume to pieces, and disposed of the drawings
separately, and that many of them came into the cabinets of the King,
and Sig. Crozat. Others say, and it is more credible, that Vasari&rsquo;s
collection passed into that of the Grand Dukes of Medici.</p>

<p><i>A head of Americo Vespucci</i>, in charcoal, but copied by Vasari in pen
and ink<a name="FNanchor_CXXIV_124" id="FNanchor_CXXIV_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_CXXIV_124"

<p><i>An head of Scarramuccia, captain of the gypsies</i>, in chalk; formerly
belonging to Pierfrancesco Giambullari, canon of St. Lorenzo, at
Florence, and left by him to Donato Valdambrini of Arezzo, canon of St.
Lorenzo also<a name="FNanchor_CXXVI_126" id="FNanchor_CXXVI_126">

<p><i>Several designs of combatants on horseback</i>, made by Leonardo for
Gentil Borri, a master of defence<a name="FNanchor_CXXVII_127" id="FNanchor_CXXVII_127">
</a><a href="#Footnote_CXXVII_127" class="fnanchor">[i127]</a>, to shew the different positions
necessary for a horse soldier in defending himself, and attacking his
enemy.</p>

<p><i>A carton of our Saviour, the Virgin, St. Ann,<span class="pagenum">
<a name="Page_lxxxi" id="Page_lxxxi">[Pg lxxxi]</a></span> and St. John.</i> Vasari
says of this, that for two days, people of all sorts, men and women,
young and old, resorted to Leonardo&rsquo;s house to see this wonderful
performance, as if they had been going to a solemn feast; and adds, that
this carton was afterwards in France. It seems that this was intended
for an altar-piece for the high altar of the church of the Annunziata,
but the picture was never painted<a name="FNanchor_CXXVIII_128" id="FNanchor_CXXVIII_128"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_CXXVIII_128" class="fnanchor">[i128]</a>. However, when Leonardo afterwards
went into France, he, at the desire of Francis the First, put the design
into colours. Lomazzo has said, that this carton of St. Ann was carried
into France; that in his time it was at Milan, in the possession of
Aurelio Lovino, a painter; and that many drawings from it were in
existence. What was the fate this carton of St. Ann underwent, may be
seen in a letter of P. Resta, printed in the third volume of the Lettere
Pittoriche, in which he says, that Leonardo made three of these cartons,
and nevertheless did not convert it into a picture, but that it was
painted by Salai, and that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxxxii"
id="Page_lxxxii">[Pg lxxxii]</a></span> the picture is still in the sacristy of St.
Celsus at Milan<a name="FNanchor_CXXIX_129" id="FNanchor_CXXIX_129">

<p><i>A drawing of an old man&rsquo;s head, seen in front</i>, in red chalk; mentioned
Lett. Pitt. vol. ii. p. 191.</p>

<p><i>A carton</i> designed by him <i>for painting the council-chamber at
Florence</i>. The subject which he chose for this purpose was, the history
of Niccolo Piccinino, the Captain of Duke Philip of Milan, in which he
drew a group of men on horseback fighting for a standard<a name="FNanchor_CXXX_130"
id="FNanchor_CXXX_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_CXXX_130" class="fnanchor">[i130]</a>. Mariette,
in a note, Lett. Pitt. vol. ii. p. 193, mentions this carton, which he
says represented two horsemen fighting for a standard; that it was only
part of a large history, the subject of which was the rout of Niccolo
Piccinino, General of the army of Philip Duke of Milan, and that a
print was engraven of it by Edelinck, when young, but the drawing from
which he worked was a bad one. In the catalogue of prints from the
works of Leonardo, inserted Lett. Pitt. vol. ii. p. 195, this print is
again mentioned and described more truly, as representing four horsemen
fighting for a standard. It is there supposed to have been engraven
from a drawing by Fiammingo, and that this drawing might have been made
from the picture which Du Fresne speaks of as being in his time in the
possession of Sig. La Maire, an excellent painter of perspective.</p>

<p><i>A book of the Anatomy of man</i>, mentioned by Vasari, p. 36, the drawings
for which were made with the assistance of Marc Antonio della Torre,
before noticed in the present life. It is probably the same with the
preceding.</p>

<p>A beautiful and well-preserved study in red and black chalk, of the
<i>head of a Virgin</i>, from which he afterwards painted a picture. This
study was at one time in the celebrated Villa de Vecchietti, but
afterwards, in consequence of a sale, passed into the hands of Sig.
Ignazio Hugford<a name="FNanchor_CXXXIII_133" id="FNanchor_CXXXIII_133"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_CXXXIII_133" class="fnanchor">[i133]</a>.</p>

<p><i>Two heads of women in profile</i>, little differing from each other, drawn
in like manner in black and red chalk, bought at the same sale by Sig.
Hugford, but now among the Elector Palatine&rsquo;s collection of drawings<a name="FNanchor_CXXXIV_134"
id="FNanchor_CXXXIV_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_CXXXIV_134" class="fnanchor">[i134]</a>.</p>

<p><i>A book of the Anatomy of a horse</i>, mentioned by Vasari, p. 36, as
a distinct work; but probably included in Leonardo&rsquo;s manuscript
collections. See the account before given of them.</p>

<p>Several designs by Leonardo were in the possession of Sig. Jabac, who
seems to have been a collector of pictures, and to have bought up for
the King of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxxxiv" id="Page_lxxxiv">[Pg lxxxiv]</a></span>

<p><i>A drawing of a young man embracing an old woman</i>, whom he is caressing
for the sake of her riches. This is mentioned, Lett. Pitt. vol. ii. p.
198, as engraven by Hollar, in 1646.</p>

<p><i>A head of a young man seen in profile</i>, engraven in aqua fortis by
Conte di Caylus, from a drawing in the King of France&rsquo;s collection<a name="FNanchor_CXXXVI_136"
id="FNanchor_CXXXVI_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_CXXXVI_136" class="fnanchor">[i136]</a>.</p>

<p><i>A fragment of a Treatise on the Motions of the Human Body</i>, already
mentioned in the foregoing life.</p>

<p>In the Lettere Pittoriche, vol. ii. p. 199, mention is made of a print
representing <i>some intertwisted lines upon a black ground</i>, in the style
of some of Albert Durer&rsquo;s engravings in wood. In the middle of this, in
a small compartment, is to be read, &ldquo;<span class="smcap">Academia Leonardi Vin</span>.&rdquo;
Vasari, it is there said, has noticed it as a singularity.</p>

<p>In p. 200 of the same work, a similar print is also noticed, which
differs only in the inscription from the former. In this last it is
<span class="smcap">Academia Leonardi Vici</span>. Both this and the former print are said
to be extremely rare, and only to have been seen in the King of France&rsquo;s
collection. It does not however appear from any thing in the Lett. Pitt.
that they were designed by Leonardo.</p>

<p>The Abate di Villeloin, in his Catalogue of Prints<span class="pagenum">
<a name="Page_lxxxv" id="Page_lxxxv">[Pg lxxxv]</a></span> published in 1666,
speaks, under the article of Leonardo da Vinci, of a print of the taking
down from the Cross; but the Lett. Pitt. says it was engraven from Eneas
Vico, not from Leonardo<a name="FNanchor_CXXXVII_137" id="FNanchor_CXXXVII_137">
</a><a href="#Footnote_CXXXVII_137" class="fnanchor">[i137]</a>.</p>

<p><i>Two drawings of monsters</i>, mentioned by Lomazzo, consisting of a boy&rsquo;s
head each, but horribly distorted by the misplacing of the features, and
the introduction of other members not in Nature to be found there. These
two drawings were in the hands of Francesco Borella, a sculptor<a name="FNanchor_CXXXVIII_138"

<p><i>The proportions of the human body.</i> The original of this is preserved
in the possession of Sig. Pagave. At the head and foot of this drawing
is to be read the description which begins thus: <i>Tanto apre l&rsquo;Uomo

<p><i>The Circumcision</i>, a large drawing mentioned Lett. Pitt. vol. ii. 283,
as the work of Leonardo, by Nicolo Gabburri, in a letter dated Florence,
4th Oct. 1732, and addressed <i>Al Sig. Pietro Mariette</i>. Gabburri says<span class="pagenum">
<a name="Page_lxxxvi" id="Page_lxxxvi">[Pg lxxxvi]</a></span>
he saw this drawing, and that it was done on white paper a little
tinted with Indian ink, and heightened with ceruse. Its owner then was
Alessandro Galilei, an architect of Florence.</p>

<p><i>A drawing consisting of several laughing heads, in the middle of which
is another head in profile, crowned with oak leaves.</i> This drawing was
the property of the Earl of Arundel, and was engraven by Hollar in
1646<a name="FNanchor_CXLII_142" id="FNanchor_CXLII_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_CXLII_142"

<p><i>A man sitting, and collecting in a looking-glass the rays of the sun,
to dazzle the eyes of a dragon who is fighting with a lion.</i> A print of
this is spoken of, Lett. Pitt. vol. ii. p. 197, as badly engraven by an
anonymous artist, but it is there said to have so little of Leonardo&rsquo;s
manner as to afford reason for believing it not designed by him, though
it might perhaps be found among his drawings in the King of France&rsquo;s
collection. Another print of it, of the same size, has been engraven
from the drawing by Conte de Caylus. It represents a pensive man, and
differs from the former in this respect, that in this the man is naked,
whereas in the drawing he is clothed.</p>

first Place to learn.</i></h4>

<p><span class="smcap"><span class="s2 bold">T</span>he</span> young student should, in the first place, acquire a knowledge
of perspective, to enable him to give to every object its proper
dimensions: after which, it is requisite that he be under the care of
an able master, to accustom him, by degrees, to a good style of drawing
the parts. Next, he must study Nature, in order to confirm and fix in
his mind the reason of those precepts which he has learnt. He must also
bestow some time in viewing the works of various old masters, to form
his eye<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a>
</span> and judgment, in order that he may be able to put in practice
all that he has been taught<a name="FNanchor_1_211" id="FNanchor_1_211">

<h4><a name="Chap_II" id="Chap_II"></a><span
class="smcap">Chap. II.</span>&mdash;<i>Rule for a young Student in Painting.</i></h4>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> organ of sight is one of the quickest, and takes in at a single
glance an infinite variety of forms; notwithstanding which, it cannot
perfectly comprehend more than one object at a time. For example, the
reader, at one look over this page, immediately perceives it full of
different characters; but he cannot at the same moment distinguish each
letter, much less can he comprehend their meaning. He must consider it
word by word, and line by line, if he be desirous of forming a just
notion of these characters. In like manner, if we wish to ascend to the
top of an edifice, we must be content to advance step by step, otherwise
we shall never be able to attain it.</p>

<p>A young man, who has a natural inclination to the study of this art,
I would advise to act thus: In order to acquire a true notion of the
form of things, he must begin by studying the parts which compose them,
and not pass to a second till he has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3"
id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span> well stored his memory, and
sufficiently practised the first; otherwise he loses his time, and will
most certainly protract his studies. And let him remember to acquire
accuracy before he attempts quickness.</p>

<h4><a name="Chap_III" id="Chap_III"></a><span
class="smcap">Chap. III.</span>&mdash;<i>How to discover a young Man&rsquo;s Disposition for
Painting.</i></h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Many</span> are very desirous of learning to draw, and are very fond of it, who
are, notwithstanding, void of a proper disposition for it. This may be
known by their want of perseverance; like boys, who draw every thing in
a hurry, never finishing, or shadowing.</p>

<h4><a name="Chap_IV" id="Chap_IV"></a><span
class="smcap">Chap. IV.</span>&mdash;<i>Of Painting, and its Divisions.</i></h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Painting</span> is divided into two principal parts. The first is the figure,
that is, the lines which distinguish the forms of bodies, and their
component parts. The second is the colour contained within those limits.</p>

<h4><a name="Chap_V" id="Chap_V"></a><span
class="smcap">Chap. V.</span>&mdash;<i>Division of the Figure.</i></h4>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> form of bodies is divided into two parts; that is, the proportion of
the members to each other, which must correspond with the whole; and the
motion, expressive of what passes in the mind of the living figure.</p>

<h4><a name="Chap_VI" id="Chap_VI"></a><span
class="smcap">Chap. VI.</span>&mdash;<i>Proportion of Members.</i></h4>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> proportion of members is again divided into two parts, viz.
equality, and motion. By equality is meant (besides the measure
corresponding with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4"
id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span> whole), that you do not confound the members
of a young subject with those of old age, nor plump ones with those
that are lean; and that, moreover, you do not blend the robust and firm
muscles of man with feminine softness: that the attitudes and motions of
old age be not expressed with the quickness and alacrity of youth; nor
those of a female figure like those of a vigorous young man. The motions
and members of a strong man should be such as to express his perfect
state of health.</p>

<h4><a name="Chap_VII" id="Chap_VII"></a><span
class="smcap">Chap. VII.</span>&mdash;<i>Of Dimensions in general.</i></h4>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> general, the dimensions of the human body are to be considered in
the length, and not in the breadth; because in the wonderful works of
Nature, which we endeavour to imitate, we cannot in any species find any
one part in one model precisely similar to the same part in another. Let
us be attentive, therefore, to the variation of forms, and avoid all
monstrosities of proportion; such as long legs united to short bodies,
and narrow chests with long arms. Observe also attentively the measure
of joints, in which Nature is apt to vary considerably; and imitate her
example by doing the same.</p>

<h4><a name="Chap_VIII" id="Chap_VIII"></a>
<span class="smcap">Chap. VIII.</span>&mdash;<i>Motion, Changes, and Proportion of Members.</i></h4>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> measures of the human body vary in each member, according as it is
more or less bent, or seen in different views, increasing on one side as
much as they diminish on the other.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span></p>

<h4><a name="Chap_IX" id="Chap_IX"></a>
<span class="smcap">Chap. IX.</span>&mdash;<i>The Difference of Proportion between Children and
grown Men.</i></h4>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> men and children I find a great difference between the joints of the
one and the other in the length of the bones. A man has the length of
two heads from the extremity of one shoulder to the other, the same from
the shoulder to the elbow, and from the elbow to the fingers; but the
child has only one, because Nature gives the proper size first to the
seat of the intellect, and afterwards to the other parts.</p>

<h4><a name="Chap_X" id="Chap_X"></a>
<span class="smcap">Chap. X.</span>&mdash;<i>The Alterations in the Proportion of the human Body
from Infancy to full Age.</i></h4>

<p><span class="smcap">A man</span>, in his infancy, has the breadth of his shoulders equal to the
length of the face, and to the length of the arm from the shoulder to
the elbow, when the arm is bent<a name="FNanchor_2_212" id="FNanchor_2_212"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_2_212" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>. It is the same again from the
lower belly to the knee, and from the knee to the foot. But, when a
man is arrived at the period of his full growth, every one of these
dimensions becomes double in length, except the face, which, with the
top of the head, undergoes but very little alteration in length. A
well-proportioned and full-grown man, therefore, is ten times the length
of his face; the breadth of his shoulders will be two faces, and in like
manner all the above lengths will be double. The rest will<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span> be explained
in the general measurement of the human body<a name="FNanchor_3_213"

<h4><a name="Chap_XI" id="Chap_XI"></a>
<span class="smcap">Chap. XI.</span>&mdash;<i>Of the Proportion of Members.</i></h4>

<p><span class="smcap">All</span> the parts of any animal whatever must be correspondent with the
whole. So that, if the body be short and thick, all the members
belonging to it must be the same. One that is long and thin must have
its parts of the same kind; and so of the middle size. Something of the
same may be observed in plants, when uninjured by men or tempests; for
when thus injured they bud and grow again, making young shoots from old
plants, and by those means destroying their natural symmetry.</p>

<h4><a name="Chap_XII" id="Chap_XII"></a>
<span class="smcap">Chap. XII.</span>&mdash;<i>That every Part be proportioned to its Whole.</i></h4>

same nature, viz. short arms and thick, large hands, short fingers, with
broad joints; and so of the rest.</p>

<h4><a name="Chap_XIII" id="Chap_XIII"></a>
<span class="smcap">Chap. XIII.</span>&mdash;<i>Of the Proportion of the Members.</i></h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Measure</span> upon yourself the proportion of the parts, and, if you find any
of them defective, note it down, and be very careful to avoid it in
drawing your own compositions. For this is reckoned a common fault in
painters, to delight in the imitation of themselves.</p>

regard to the Proportion and Beauty of the Parts.</i></h4>

<p><span class="smcap">If</span> the painter has clumsy hands, he will be apt to introduce them
into his works, and so of any other part of his person, which may not
happen to be so beautiful as it ought to be. He must, therefore, guard
particularly against that self-love, or too good opinion of his own
person, and study by every means to acquire the knowledge of what is
most beautiful, and of his own defects, that he may adopt the one and
avoid the other.</p>

<span class="smcap">Chap. XIX.</span>&mdash;<i>Of drawing from Nature.</i></h4>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> you draw from Nature, you must be at the distance of three times
the height of the object; and when you begin to draw, form in your own
mind a certain principal line (suppose a perpendicular); observe well
the bearing of the parts towards that line; whether they intersect, are
parallel to it, or oblique.</p>

figure, suiting all the members well to each other; and though you
finish only that part which appears the best, have a regard to the rest,
that, whenever you make use of such studies, all the parts may hang
together.</p>

<p>In composing your attitudes, take care not to turn the head on the same
side as the breast, nor let the arm go in a line with the leg<a name="FNanchor_7_217"

head turn towards the left, the parts on the right side are to be the
highest.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> cartilage, which raises the nose in the middle of the face, varies
in eight different ways. It is equally straight, equally concave,
or equally convex, which is the first sort. Or, secondly, unequally
straight, concave, or convex. Or, thirdly, straight in the upper part,
and concave in the under. Or, fourthly, straight again in the upper
part, and convex in those below. Or, fifthly, it may be concave and
straight beneath. Or, sixthly, concave above, and convex below. Or,
seventhly, it may be convex in the upper part, and straight in the
lower. And in the eighth and last place, convex above, and concave
beneath.</p>

<p>The uniting of the nose with the brows is in two ways, either it is
straight or concave. The forehead has three different forms. It is
straight, concave, or round. The first is divided into two parts, viz.
it is either convex in the upper part, or in the lower, sometimes both;
or else flat above and below.</p>

once.</i></h4>

<p><span class="smcap">You</span> must observe and remember well the variations of the four principal
features in the profile; the nose, mouth, chin, and forehead. And first
of the nose, of which there are three different sorts<a name="FNanchor_8_218"
id="FNanchor_8_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_218" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>, straight,
concave, and convex. Of the straight there are but four variations,
short or long, high at the end, or low. Of the concave there are three
sorts; some have the concavity above, some in the middle, and some at
the end. The convex noses also vary three ways; some project in the
upper part, some in the middle, and others at the bottom. Nature, which
seems to delight in infinite variety, gives again three changes to those
noses which have a projection in the middle; for some have it straight,
some concave, and some convex.</p>

<h4><a name="Chap_XXIV" id="Chap_XXIV"></a>
<span class="smcap">Chap. XXIV.</span>&mdash;<i>How to remember the Form of a Face.</i></h4>

<p><span class="smcap">If</span> you wish to retain with facility the general look of a face, you must
first learn how to draw well several faces, mouths, eyes, noses, chins,
throats, necks, and shoulders; in short, all those principal parts
which distinguish one man from another. For instance, noses are often
different sorts<a name="FNanchor_9_219" id="FNanchor_9_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_219"
class="fnanchor">[9]</a>. Straight,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12"
id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span> bunched, concave, some raised above,
some below the middle, aquiline, flat, round, and sharp. These affect
the profile. In the front view there are eleven different sorts. Even,
thick in the middle, thin in the middle, thick at the tip, thin at the
beginning, thin at the tip, and thick at the beginning. Broad, narrow,
high, and low nostrils; some with a large opening, and some more shut
towards the tip.</p>

<p>The same variety will be found in the other parts of the face, which
must be drawn from Nature, and retained in the memory. Or else, when you
mean to draw a likeness from memory, take with you a pocket-book, in
which you have marked all these variations of features, and after having
given a look at the face you mean to draw, retire a little aside, and
note down in your book which of the features are similar to it; that you
may put it all together at home.</p>

defect. Now, if we know that men are able to judge of the works of

the joints, which increase and diminish the length of them in their
appearance. As in the arm, which does not measure the same when bent,
as when extended; its difference between the greatest extension and
bending, is about one eighth of its length. The increase and diminution
of the arm is effected by the bone projecting out of its socket at the
elbow; which, as <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a>

<p><span class="smcap">Young</span> children have all their joints small, but they are thick and plump
in the spaces between them; because there is nothing upon the bones
at the joints, but some tendons to bind the bones together. The soft
flesh, which is full of fluids, is enclosed under the skin in the space
between the joints; and as the bones are bigger at the joints than in
the space between them, the skin throws off in the progress to manhood
that superfluity, and draws nearer to the bones, thinning the whole part
together. But upon the joints it does not lessen, as there is nothing
but cartilages and tendons. For these reasons children are small in the
joints, and plump in the space between, as may be observed in their
fingers, arms, and narrow shoulders. Men, on the contrary, are large
and full in the joints, in the arms and legs; and where children have
hollows, men are knotty and prominent.</p>

the hand the muscles are extended and thinned in the arm, from the elbow
to the wrist; but when the hand is shut, the same muscles swell and
shorten. The tendons alone start, being stretched by the clenching of
the hand.</p>

be too much marked, nor are any of them to be much swelled. Because such

flesh, and where there is but little flesh there cannot be any thickness
of muscles.</p>

very little fat; because the fleshy muscles in their growth contract
closer together, and the fat, which in other instances lodges between
them, has no room. The muscles in such thin subjects, not being able to
extend, grow in thickness, particularly towards their middle, in the
parts most removed from the extremities.</p>

acquire a greater relievo. A similar effect is produced by the hips,
when they bend either inwards or outwards. It is to be observed, that
there is more variety of appearances in the shoulders, hips, and neck,
than in any other joint, because they are susceptible of the greatest
variety of motions. But of this subject I shall make a separate

would be disagreeable to the sight, and of very difficult execution.
But on that side only where the members are in action, they should be
pronounced more strongly; for muscles that are at work naturally collect
all their parts together, to gain increase of strength, so that some
small parts of those muscles will appear, that were not seen before.</p>

which they have not yet attained. Nevertheless they must be more or

in motion are always more swelled and thicker than those which remain
at rest. The intrinsic and central line of the members which are bent,
never retains its natural length.</p>

<span class="smcap">Chap. XLVI.</span>&mdash;<i>The Extension and Contraction of the Muscles.</i></h4>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> muscle at the back part of the thigh shows more variety in its
extension and contraction, than any other in the human body; the second,
in that respect, are those which compose the buttocks; the third, those
of the back; the fourth, those of the neck; the fifth, those of the
shoulders; and the sixth, those of the Abdomen, which, taking their rise
under the breast, terminate under the lower belly; as I shall explain
when I speak of each.</p>

<h4><a name="Chap_XLVII" id="Chap_XLVII"></a>
<span class="smcap">Chap. XLVII.</span>&mdash;<i>Of the Muscle between the Chest and the lower

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> is a muscle which begins under the breast at the Sternum, and is
inserted into, or terminates at the Os pubis, under the lower belly.
It is called the Rectus of the Abdomen; it is divided, lengthways,<span class="pagenum">
<a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
into three principal portions, by transverse tendinous intersections or
ligaments, viz. the superior part, and a ligament; the second part, with
its ligaments; and the third part, with the third ligament; which last
unites by tendons to the Os pubis. These divisions and intersections of
the same muscle are intended by nature to facilitate the motion when
the body is bent or distended. If it were made of one piece, it would
produce too much variety when extended, or contracted, and also would
be considerably weaker. When this muscle has but little variety in the
motion of the body, it is more beautiful<a name="FNanchor_14_224" id="FNanchor_14_224">

<h4><a name="Chap_XLVIII" id="Chap_XLVIII"></a>
<span class="smcap">Chap. XLVIII.</span>&mdash;<i>Of a Man&rsquo;s complex Strength, but first of the
Arm.</i></h4>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> muscles which serve either to straighten or bend the arm, arise
from the different processes of the Scapula; some of them from the
protuberances of the Humerus, and others about the middle of the Os
humeri. The extensors of the arm arise from behind, and the flexors from
before.</p>

<p>That a man has more power in pulling than in pushing, has been proved
by the ninth proposition De Ponderibus<a name="FNanchor_15_225"
id="FNanchor_15_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_225"
class="fnanchor">[15]</a>, where it is said, that of
two equal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a>
</span> weights, that will have the greatest power which is farthest
removed from the pole or centre of its balance. It follows then of
course, that the muscle N B, <i>Plate II.</i> and the muscle N C, being of
equal power, the inner muscle N C, will nevertheless be stronger than
the outward one N B, because it is inserted into the arm at C, a point
farther removed from the centre of the elbow A, than B, which is on the
other side of such centre, so that that question is determined. But
this is a simple power, and I thought it best to explain it before I
mentioned the complex power of the muscles, of which I must now take
notice. The complex power, or strength, is, for instance, this, when
the arm is going to act, a second power is added to it (such as the
weight of the body and the strength of the legs, in pulling or pushing),
consisting in the extension of the parts, as when two men attempt to
throw down a column; the one by pushing, and the other by pulling<a name="FNanchor_16_226"
id="FNanchor_16_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_226" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>.</p>

<h4><a name="Chap_XLIX" id="Chap_XLIX"></a>
<span class="smcap">Chap. XLIX.</span>&mdash;<i>In which of the two Actions, Pulling or Pushing,
a Man has the greatest Power</i>, Plate II.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">A man</span> has the greatest power in pulling, for in that action he has the
united exertion of all the muscles of the arm, while some of them must
be inactive when he is pushing; because when the arm is extended for
that purpose, the muscles which move the elbow cannot act, any more than
if he pushed with his shoulders against the column he means to throw
down; in which case only the muscles that extend the back, the legs
under the thigh, and the calves of the legs, would be active. From which
we conclude, that in pulling there is added to the power of extension
the strength of the arms, of the legs, of the back, and even of the
chest, if the oblique motion of the body require it. But in pushing,
though all the parts were employed, yet the strength of the muscles of
the arms is wanting; for to push with an extended arm without motion
does not help more than if a piece of wood were placed from the shoulder
to the column meant to be pushed down.</p>

always be in a perpendicular line upon the centre of that foot which
supports the body; and if he rests equally upon both feet, then the
middle of the chest will be perpendicular to the middle of the line
which measures the space between the centres of his feet.</p>

<p>The complex balance is, when a man carries a weight not his own, which
he bears by different motions; as in the figure of Hercules stifling
Anteus, by pressing him against his breast with his arms, after he has

<p>Any body, moving of itself, will do it with more or less velocity in
proportion as the centre of its gravity is more or less removed from the
centre of its support. This is mentioned chiefly in regard to the motion
of birds, which, without any clapping of their wings, or assistance of
wind, move themselves. This happens when the centre of their gravity is
out of the centre of their support, viz. out of its usual residence, the
middle between the two wings. Because, if the middle of the wings be
more backward than the centre of the whole weight, the bird will move
forwards and downwards, in a greater or less degree as the centre of its
weight is more or less removed from the middle of its wings. From which
it follows, that if the centre of gravity be far removed from the other
centre, the descent of the bird will be very oblique; but if that centre
be near the middle of the wings, the descent will have very little
obliquity.</p>

<span class="smcap">Chap. LXXIX.</span>&mdash;<i>In what Manner extending one Arm alters the
Balance.</i></h4>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> extending of the arm, which was bent, removes the weight of the

observable in rope-dancers, who dance upon the rope with their arms

<h4><a name="Chap_LXXX" id="Chap_LXXX"></a>
<span class="smcap">Chap. LXXX.</span>&mdash;<i>Of a Man bearing a Weight on his Shoulders</i>,

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> shoulder which bears the weight is always higher than the other.
This is seen in the figure opposite, in which the centre line passes
through the whole, with an equal weight on each side, to the leg on
which it rests. If the weight were not equally divided on each side
of this central line of gravity, the whole would fall to the ground.
But Nature has provided, that as much of the natural weight of the man
should be thrown on one side, as of accidental weight on the other, to
form a counterpoise. This is effected by the man&rsquo;s bending, and leaning
on the side not loaded, so as to form an equilibrium to the accidental
weight he carries; and this cannot be done, unless the loaded shoulder
be raised, and the other lowered. This is the resource with which Nature
has furnished a man on such occasions.</p>

<h4><a name="Chap_LXXXI" id="Chap_LXXXI"></a>
<span class="smcap">Chap. LXXXI.</span>&mdash;<i>Of Equilibrium.</i></h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Any</span> figure bearing an additional weight out of the central line, must
throw as much natural or accidental weight on the opposite side as is
sufficient to form a counterpoise round that line, which passes from
the pit of the neck, through the whole mass of weight, to that part
of the foot which rests upon the ground. We observe, that when a man
lifts a weight with one arm, he naturally throws out the opposite arm;
and if that be not enough to form an equipoise, he will add as much of
his own weight, by bending his body, as will enable him to resist such
accidental load. We see also, that a man ready to fall sideways and
backwards at the same time, always throws out the arm on the opposite
side.</p>

<i>vice vers√¢</i>, those parts will lose less of their level when the motion
is quicker. This is proved by the ninth proposition, treating of local
motions, where it is said, any weight will press in the direction of the
line of its motion; therefore the whole moving towards any one point,
the parts belonging to it will follow the shortest line of the motion of
its whole, without giving any of its weight to the collateral parts of
the whole.</p>

<span class="smcap">Chap. LXXXIV.</span>&mdash;<i>Objection to the above answered</i>, Plate XI. and
XII.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> has been objected, in regard to the first part of the above
proposition, that it does not follow that a man standing still, or
moving slowly, has his members always in perfect balance upon the centre
of gravity; because we do not find that Nature always follows that rule,
but, on the contrary, the figure will sometimes bend sideways, standing
upon one foot; sometimes it will rest part of its weight upon that leg
which is bent at the knee, as is seen in the figures B C. But I shall
reply thus, that what is not performed by the shoulders in the figure C,
is done by the hip, as is demonstrated in another place.</p>

<h4><a name="Chap_LXXXV" id="Chap_LXXXV"></a>
<span class="smcap">Chap. LXXXV.</span>&mdash;<i>Of the Position of Figures</i>, Plate XIII.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the same proportion as that part of the naked figure marked D A,
lessens in height from the shoulder to the hip, on account of its
position the opposite side increases. And this is the reason: the figure
resting upon one (suppose the left) foot, that foot becomes the centre
of all the weight above; and the pit of the neck, formed by the junction
of the two Clavicles, quits also its natural situation at the upper
extremity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a>
</span> of the perpendicular line (which passes through the middle
surface of the body), to bend over the same foot; and as this line bends
with it, it forces the transverse lines, which are always at right
angles, to lower their extremities on that side where the foot rests,
as appears in A B C. The navel and middle parts always preserve their
natural height.</p>

<h4><a name="Chap_LXXXVI" id="Chap_LXXXVI"></a>
<span class="smcap">Chap. LXXXVI.</span>&mdash;<i>Of the Joints.</i></h4>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the bending of the joints it is particularly useful to observe the
difference and variety of shape they assume; how the muscles swell on
one side, while they flatten on the other; and this is more apparent in
the neck, because the motion of it is of three sorts, two of which are
simple motions, and the other complex, participating also of the other
two.</p>

<p>The simple motions are, first, when the neck bends towards the shoulder,
either to the right or left, and when it raises or lowers the head.
The second is, when it twists to the right or left, without rising
or bending, but straight, with the head turned towards one of the
shoulders. The third motion, which is called complex, is, when to the
bending of it is added the twisting, as when the ear leans towards one
of the shoulders, the head turning the same way, and the face turned
upwards.</p>

<h4><a name="Chap_LXXXVII" id="Chap_LXXXVII"></a>
<span class="smcap">Chap. LXXXVII.</span>&mdash;<i>Of the Shoulders.</i></h4>

<p><span class="smcap bottom1">Of</span> those which the shoulders can perform, simple motions are the
principal, such as moving the arm upwards and downwards, backwards and
forwards. Though one might almost call those motions infinite, for if
the arm can trace a circle upon a wall, it will have performed all the
motions belonging to the shoulders. Every continued quantity being
divisible <i>ad infinitum</i>, and this circle being a continued quantity,
produced by the motion of the arm going through every part of the
circumference, it follows, that the motions of the shoulders may also be
said to be infinite.</p>

strength of the effort that the legs and back make when they are bent,

going to jump, prompt him to raise his arms and shoulders by a sudden
motion, together with a great part of his body, and to lift them up
high, till the power of the effort subsides. This impetuous motion
is accompanied by an instantaneous extension of the body which had
bent itself, like a spring or bow, along the back, the joints of the
thighs, knees, and feet, and is let off obliquely, that is, upwards

<p><span class="smcap bottom1">In</span> regard to the freedom and ease of motions, it is very necessary to
observe, that when you mean to represent a figure which has to turn
itself a little round, the feet and all the other members are not
to move in the same direction as the head. But you will divide that
motion among four joints, viz. the feet, the knees, the hips, and the
neck. If it rests upon the right leg, the left knee should be a little
bent inward, with its foot somewhat raised outward. The left shoulder
should be lower than the other, and the nape of the neck turned on the
same side as the outward ankle of the left foot, and the left shoulder
perpendicular over the great toe of the right foot. And take it as a
general maxim, that figures do not turn their heads straight with the
chest, Nature having for our convenience formed the neck so as to turn
with ease on every side, when the eyes want to look round; and to this
the other joints are in some measure subservient. If the figure be
sitting, and the arms have some employment across the body, the breast
will turn over the joint of the hip.</p>

his legs bent on each side as often as backwards and forwards, and
seldom or never straight with the thigh. Besides, this joint can bend
only one way, so that in walking it can never go beyond the straight
line of the leg; it bends only forwards, for if it could bend backwards,
a man could never get up again upon his feet, if once he were kneeling;
as when he means to get up from the kneeling posture (on both knees),
he gives the whole weight of his body to one of the knees to support,
unloading the other, which at that time feels no other weight than its
own, and therefore is lifted up with ease, and rests his foot flat upon
the ground; then returning the whole weight upon that foot, and leaning
his hand upon his knee, he at once extends the other arm, raises his
head, and straightening the thigh with the body, he springs up, and
rests upon the same foot, while he brings up the other.</p>

<span class="smcap">Chap. XCVIII.</span>&mdash;<i>Postures of Figures.</i></h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Figures</span> that are set in a fixed attitude, are nevertheless to have some
contrast of parts. If one arm come before, the other remains still or
goes behind. If the figure rest upon one leg, the shoulder on that side
will be lower than the other. This is observed by artists of judgment,
who always take care to balance the figure well upon its feet, for fear
it should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a>
</span> appear to fall. Because by resting upon one foot, the other
leg, being a little bent, does not support the body any more than if
it were dead; therefore it is necessary that the parts above that leg
should transfer the centre of their weight upon the leg which supports
the body.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> members are to be suited to the body in graceful motions, expressive
of the meaning which the figure is intended to convey. If it had to
give the idea of genteel and agreeable carriage, the members must
be slender and well turned, but not lean; the muscles very slightly
marked, indicating in a soft manner such as must necessarily appear;
the arms, particularly, pliant, and no member in a straight line with
any other adjoining member. If it happen, on account of the motion of
the figure, that the right hip be higher than the left, make the joint
of the shoulder fall perpendicularly on the highest part of that hip;
and let that right shoulder be lower than the left. The pit of the neck
will always be perpendicular over the middle of the instep of the foot
that supports the body. The leg that does not bear will have its knee a
little lower than the other, and near the other leg.</p>

for that reason I shall not enter into any detailed rule concerning

a continued quantity, and consequently divisible <i>ad infinitum</i>, and in
every part of the motion varies to its view the aspect and figure of the

by degrees at last they become invisible. I find by experience, that, if
the second object be at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a>
</span> the same distance from the first, as the first
is from the eye, though they be of the same size, the second will appear
half the size of the first; and, if the third be at the same distance
behind the second, it will diminish two thirds; and so on, by degrees,
they will, at equal distances, diminish in proportion; provided that the
interval be not more than twenty cubits<a name="FNanchor_26_236" id="FNanchor_26_236">
</a><a href="#Footnote_26_236" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>; at which distance it will
lose two fourths of its size: at forty it will diminish three fourths;
and at sixty it will lose five sixths, and so on progressively. But you
must be distant from your picture twice the size of it; for, if you be
only once the size, it will make a great difference in the measure from
the first to the second.</p>

large ones, and the perception of them is less, in proportion as they
are less in magnitude. It follows then, that if the large objects, by

entirely disappear.</p>

although the parts, by being so much diminished or reduced, cannot be
executed with the same exactness of proportion, nor finished with the
same accuracy, as if on a larger scale, yet on that very account the
faults will be less conspicuous. For example, if you look at a man at
the distance of two hundred yards, and with all due attention mean
to form a judgment, whether he be handsome or ugly, deformed or well
made, you will find that, with all your endeavours, you can hardly
venture to decide. The reason is, that the man diminishes so much by the
distance, that it is impossible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a>
</span> to distinguish the parts minutely. If
you wish to know by demonstration the diminution of the above figure,
hold your finger up before your eye at about nine inches distance, so
that the top of your finger corresponds with the top of the head of the
distant figure: you will perceive that your finger covers, not only its
head, but part of its body; which is an evident proof of the apparent
diminution of that object. Hence it often happens, that we are doubtful,
and can scarcely, at some distance, distinguish the form of even a
friend.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> custom, which has been generally adopted by painters, on the front
and sides of chapels, is much to be condemned. They begin with an
historical picture, its landscape and buildings, in one compartment.
After which, they raise another compartment, and execute another history
with other buildings upon another level; and from thence they proceed
to a third and fourth, varying the point of sight, as if the beholder
was going up steps, while, in fact, he must look at them all from below,
which is very ill judged in those matters.</p>

<p>We know that the point of sight is the eye of the spectator; and if
you ask, how is a series of subjects, such as the life of a saint, to
be represented, in different compartments on the same wall? I answer,
that you are to place the principal event in the largest compartment,
and make the point of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a>
</span> sight as high as the eye of the spectator. Begin
that subject with large figures; and as you go up, lessen the objects,
as well the figures, as buildings, varying the plans according to the
effect of perspective; but never varying the point of sight: and so
complete the series of subjects, till you come to a certain height,
where terrestrial objects can be seen no more, except the tops of trees,
or clouds and birds; or if you introduce figures, they must be aerial,
such as angels, or saints in glory, or the like, if they suit the
purpose of your history. If not, do not undertake this kind of painting,

<p><span class="smcap">Painters</span> often despair of being able to imitate Nature, from
observing, that their pictures have not the same relief, nor the same
life, as natural objects have in a looking-glass, though they both
appear upon a plain surface. They say, they have colours which surpass
in brightness the quality of the lights,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55"

the shades of the objects seen in the looking-glass; but attribute this
circumstance to their own ignorance, and not to the true cause, because
they do not know it. It is impossible that objects in painting should
appear with the same relief as those in the looking-glass, unless we
look at them with only one eye.</p>

<p class="bottom1">The reason is this. The two eyes A B looking at objects one behind
another, as M and N, see them both; because M cannot entirely occupy
the space of N, by reason that the base of the visual rays is so broad,
that the second object is seen behind the first. But if one eye be shut,
and you look with the other S, the body F will entirely cover the body
R, because the visual rays beginning at one point, form a triangle,
of which the body F is the base, and being prolonged, they form two
diverging tangents at the two extremities of F, which cannot touch the
body R behind it, therefore can never see it<a name="FNanchor_30_240" id="FNanchor_30_240">

small they are to be brought up close to the eye. But large paintings
are seen at some distance; whence it happens, that though the figures
in each are so different in size, in appearance they will be the same.
This proceeds from the eye receiving those objects under the same angle;
and it is proved thus. Let the large painting be B C, the eye A, and D E
a pane of glass, through which are seen the figures situated at B C. I
say that the eye being fixed, the figures in the copy of the paintings
B C are to be smaller, in proportion as the glass D E is nearer the eye
A, and are to be as precise and finished. But if you will execute the
picture B C upon the glass D E, this ought to be less finished than the
picture B C, and more so than the figure M N transferred upon the glass
F G; because, supposing the figure P O to be as much finished as the
natural one in B C, the perspective of O P would be false, since, though

diminished in P O, the finishing would not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58"

because in giving it the perfection of the natural B C, B C would appear

and having acquired this knowledge, his constant care should be to avoid
conveying into his work those defects which he has found in his own
person; for these defects, becoming habitual to his observation, mislead
his judgment, and he perceives them no longer. We ought, therefore,
to struggle against such a prejudice, which grows up with us; for the
mind, being fond of its own habitation, is apt to represent it to our
imagination as beautiful. From the same motive it may be, that there is
not a woman, however plain in her person, who may not find her admirer,
if she be not a monster. Against this bent of the mind you ought very
cautiously to be on your guard.</p>

be your delight to observe and consider in your walks the different
actions of men, when they are talking, or quarrelling; when they laugh,
and when they fight. Attend to their positions, and to those of the
spectators; whether they are attempting to separate those who fight, or
merely lookers-on. Be quick in sketching these with slight strokes in
your pocket-book, which should always be about you, and made of stained
paper, as you ought not to rub out. When it is full, take another, for
these are not things to be rubbed out, but kept with the greatest care;
because forms and motions of bodies are so infinitely various, that the
memory is not able to retain them; therefore preserve these sketches as
your assistants and masters.</p>

<span class="smcap">Chap. CXLII.</span>&mdash;<i>How to study the Motions of the human Body.</i></h4>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> first requisite towards a perfect acquaintance with the various
motions of the human body, is the knowledge of all the parts,
particularly the joints, in all the attitudes in which it may be placed.
Then make slight sketches in your pocket-book, as opportunities occur,
of the actions of men, as they happen to meet your eye, without being
perceived by them; because, if they were to observe you, they would
be disturbed from that freedom of action, which is prompted by inward
feeling; as when two men are quarrelling and angry, each of them seeming
to be in the right, and with great vehemence move their eyebrows, arms,
and all the other members, using motions appropriated to their words
and feelings. This they could not do, if you wanted them to imitate
anger, or any other accidental emotion; such as laughter, weeping, pain,
admiration, fear, and the like. For that reason, take care never to
be without a little book, for the purpose of sketching those various
motions, and also groups of people standing by. This will teach you how
to compose history. Two things demand the principal attention of a good
painter. One is the exact outline and shape of the figure; the other,
the true expression of what passes in the mind of that figure, which he
must feel, and that is very important.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> draperies with which you dress figures ought to have their folds
so accommodated as to surround the parts they are intended to cover;
that in the mass of light there be not any dark fold, and in the mass
of shadows none receiving too great a light. They must go gently over,
describing the parts; but not with lines across, cutting the members
with hard notches, deeper than the part can possibly be; at the same
time, it must fit the body, and not appear like an empty bundle of
cloth; a fault of many painters, who, enamoured of the quantity
and variety of folds, have encumbered their figures, forgetting
the intention of clothes, which is to dress and surround the parts
gracefully wherever they touch; and not to be filled with wind, like
bladders, puffed up where the parts project. I do not deny that we ought
not to neglect introducing some handsome folds among these draperies,
but it must be done with great judgment, and suited to the parts, where,
by the actions of the limbs and position of the whole body, they gather
together. Above all, be careful to vary the quality and quantity of
your folds in compositions of many figures; so that, if some have large
folds, produced by thick woollen cloth; others, being dressed in thinner
stuff, may have them narrower; some sharp and straight, others soft and
undulating.</p>

<span class="smcap">Chap. CXLV.</span>&mdash;<i>How the Folds of Draperies ought to be

<p class="bottom1"><span class="smcap">That</span> part of the drapery, which is the farthest from the place where
it is gathered, will appear more approaching its natural state. Every
thing naturally inclines to preserve its primitive form. Therefore a
stuff or cloth, which is of equal thickness on both sides, will always
incline to remain flat. For that reason, when it is constrained by some
fold to relinquish its flat situation, it is observed that, at the part
of its greatest restraint, it is continually making efforts to return
to its natural shape; and the parts most distant from it reassume more
of their primitive state by ample and distended folds. For example, let
A B C be the drapery mentioned above; A B the place where it is folded
or restrained. I have said that the part, which is farthest from the
place of its restraint, would return more towards its primitive shape.
Therefore C being the farthest, will be broader and more extended than
any other part.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Draperies</span> are not to be encumbered with many folds: on the contrary,
there ought to be some only where they are held up with the hands or
arms of the figures, and the rest left to fall with natural simplicity.
They ought to be studied from Nature; that is to say, if a woollen
cloth be intended, the folds ought to be drawn after such cloth; if it
be of silk, or thin stuff, or else very thick for labourers, let it
be distinguished by the nature of the folds. But never copy them, as
some do, after models dressed in paper, or thin leather, for it greatly
misleads.</p>

<span class="smcap">Chap. CXLVII.</span>&mdash;<i>Fore-shortening of Folds</i>, Plate XIX.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Where</span> the figure is fore-shortened, there ought to appear a greater
number of folds, than on the other parts, all surrounding it in a
circular manner. Let E be the situation of the eye. M N will have the
middle of every circular fold successively removed farther from its
outline, in proportion as it is more distant from the eye. In M O of the
other figure the outlines of these circular folds will appear almost
straight, because it is situated opposite the eye; but in P and Q quite
the contrary, as in N and M.</p>

always to shew, by the form<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a>
</span> of their outlines, the attitude of such
figure; so as to leave, in the mind of the beholder, no doubt or
confusion in regard to the true position of the body; and let there be
no fold, which, by its shadow, breaks through any of the members; that
is to say, appearing to go in deeper than the surface of the part it
covers. And if you represent the figure clothed with several garments,
one over the other, let it not appear as if the upper one covered only
a mere skeleton; but let it express that it is also well furnished with
flesh, and a thickness of folds, suitable to the number of its under
garments.</p>

<p>The folds surrounding the members ought to diminish in thickness near
the extremities of the part they surround.</p>

<p>The length of the folds, which are close to the members, ought to
produce other folds on that side where the member is diminished by
fore-shortening, and be more extended on the opposite side.</p>

action, dress, and situation, according to the dignity or meanness of
the subject to be represented. Be careful that a king, for instance,
be grave and majestic in his countenance and dress; that the place be
well decorated; and that his attendants, or the by-standers, express
reverence and admiration, and appear as noble, in dresses suitable to a
royal court.</p>

<p>On the contrary, in the representation of a mean<span class="pagenum">
<a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span> subject, let the
figures appear low and despicable; those about them with similar
countenances, and actions, denoting base and presumptuous minds, and

ordinary course of historical subjects, and those few separated from
young people; because old people are few, and their habits do not agree
with those of youth. Where there is no conformity of custom, there can
be no intimacy, and, without it, a company is soon separated. But if
the subject require an appearance of gravity, a meeting on important
business, as a council, for instance, let there be few young men
introduced, for youth willingly avoids such meetings.</p>

its muscles are not obedient to its will, and the painter very deficient
in judgment. For that reason, a figure is<span class="pagenum">
<a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span> to shew great eagerness and
meaning; and its position is to be so well appropriated to that meaning,

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> painter ought to notice those quick motions, which men are apt to
make without thinking, when impelled by strong and powerful affections
of the mind. He ought to take memorandums of them, and sketch them in
his pocket-book, in order to make use of them when they may answer his
purpose; and then to put a living model in the same position, to see the
quality and aspect of the muscles which are in action.</p>

<h4><a name="Chap_CLIII" id="Chap_CLIII"></a>
<span class="smcap">Chap. CLIII.</span>&mdash;<i>Of the Motion of Man</i>, Plates XX. and XXI.</h4>

<p class="bottom1"><span class="smcap">The</span> first and principal part of the art is composition of any sort, or
putting things together. The second relates to the expression and motion
of the figures, and requires that they be well appropriated, and seeming
attentive to what they are about; appearing to move with alacrity and
spirit, according to the degree of expression suitable to the occasion;
expressing slow and tardy motions, as well as those of eagerness in
pursuit: and that quickness and ferocity be expressed with such force
as to give an idea of the sensations of the actors. When a figure is
to throw a dart, stones, or the like, let it be seen evidently by the
attitude and disposition of all the members, that such is its intention;
of which there are two examples in the opposite plates, varied both
in action and power. The first in point of vigour is A. The second is
B. But A will throw his weapon farther than B, because, though they
seem desirous of throwing it to the same point, A having turned his
feet towards the object, while his body is twisted and bent back the
contrary way, to increase his power, returns with more velocity and
force to the point to which he means to throw. But the figure B having
turned his feet the same way as his body, it returns to its place with
great inconvenience, and consequently with weakened powers. For in the
expression of great efforts, the preparatory motions of the body must
be strong and violent, twisting and bending, so that it may return with
convenient ease, and by that means have a great effect. In the same
manner, if a cross-bow be not strung with force, the motion of whatever
it shoots will be short and without effect; because, where there is no
impulse, there can be no motion; and if the impulse be not violent,
the motion is but tardy and feeble. So a bow, which is not strong, has
no motion; and, if it be strung, it will remain in that state till the
impulse be given by another power which puts it in motion, and it will
shoot with a violence equal to that which was employed in bending it. In
the same manner, the man who does not twist and bend his body will have
acquired no power. Therefore, after A has thrown his dart, he will find
himself twisted the contrary way, viz. on the side where he has thrown;
and he will have acquired only power sufficient to serve him to return
to where he was at first.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> same attitude is not to be repeated in the same picture, nor the
same motion of members in the same figure, nay, not even in the hands
or fingers. And if the history requires a great number of figures, such
as a battle, or a massacre of soldiers, in which there are but three
ways of striking, viz. thrusting, cutting, or back-handed; in that case
you must take care, that all those who are cutting be expressed in
different views; some turning their backs, some their sides, and others
be seen in front; varying in the same manner the three different ways
of fighting, so that all the actions may have a relation to those three
principles. In battles, complex motions display great art, giving spirit
and animation to the whole. By complex motion is meant, for instance,
that of a single figure shewing the front of the legs, and at the same
time the profile of the shoulder. But of this I shall treat in another

right arm must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a>

disposition and contraste of parts, it is impossible to run well. If
another figure be supposed to follow this, one of its legs should be
brought somewhat forward, and the other be perpendicular under the head;

<span class="smcap">Chap. CLVI.</span>&mdash;<i>On the Attitudes of the human Figure.</i></h4>

<p><span class="smcap">A painter</span> is to be attentive to the motions and actions of men,
occasioned by some sudden accident. He must observe them on the spot,
take sketches, and not wait till he wants such expression, and then have
it counterfeited for him; for instance, setting a model to weep when
there is no cause; such an expression without a cause will be neither
quick nor natural. But it will be of great use to have observed every
action from nature, as it occurs, and then to have a model set in the
same attitude to help the recollection, and find out something to the
purpose, according to the subject in hand.</p>

<h4><a name="Chap_CLVII" id="Chap_CLVII"></a>
<span class="smcap">Chap. CLVII.</span>&mdash;<i>How to represent a Storm.</i></h4>

<p><span class="smcap">To</span> form a just idea of a storm, you must consider it attentively in its
effects. When the wind blows violently over the sea or land, it removes
and carries off with it every thing that is not firmly fixed to the
general mass. The clouds must appear straggling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76"
id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span> and broken, carried
according to the direction and the force of the wind, and blended with
clouds of dust raised from the sandy shore. Branches and leaves of trees
must be represented as carried along by the violence of the storm, and,
together with numberless other light substances, scattered in the air.
Trees and grass must be bent to the ground, as if yielding to the course
of the wind. Boughs must be twisted out of their natural form, with
their leaves reversed and entangled. Of the figures dispersed in the
picture, some should appear thrown on the ground, so wrapped up in their
cloaks and covered with dust, as to be scarcely distinguishable. Of
those who remain on their feet, some should be sheltered by and holding
fast behind some great trees, to avoid the same fate: others bending to
the ground, their hands over their faces to ward off the dust; their
hair and their clothes flying straight up at the mercy of the wind.</p>

<p>The high tremendous waves of the stormy sea will be covered with foaming
froth; the most subtle parts of which, being raised by the wind, like
a thick mist, mix with the air. What vessels are seen should appear
with broken cordage, and torn sails, fluttering in the wind; some with
broken masts fallen across the hulk, already on its side amidst the
tempestuous waves. Some of the crew should be represented as if crying
aloud for help, and clinging to the remains of the shattered vessel. Let
the clouds appear as driven by tempestuous winds against the summits of
lofty mountains, enveloping those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a>
</span> mountains, and breaking and recoiling
with redoubled force, like waves against a rocky shore. The air should
be rendered awfully dark, by the mist, dust, and thick clouds.</p>

<h4><a name="Chap_CLVIII" id="Chap_CLVIII"></a>
<span class="smcap">Chap. CLVIII.</span>&mdash;<i>How to compose a Battle.</i></h4>

<p><span class="smcap">First</span>, let the air exhibit a confused mixture of smoke, arising from the
discharge of artillery and musquetry, and the dust raised by the horses
of the combatants; and observe, that dust being of an earthy nature,
is heavy; but yet, by reason of its minute particles, it is easily
impelled upwards, and mixes with the air; nevertheless, it naturally
falls downwards again, the most subtle parts of it alone gaining any
considerable degree of elevation, and at its utmost height it is so
thin and transparent, as to appear nearly of the colour of the air. The
smoke, thus mixing with the dusty air, forms a kind of dark cloud, at
the top of which it is distinguished from the dust by a blueish cast,
the dust retaining more of its natural colour. On that part from which
the light proceeds, this mixture of air, smoke, and dust, will appear
much brighter than on the opposite side. The more the combatants are
involved in this turbulent mist, the less distinctly they will be seen,
and the more confused will they be in their lights and shades. Let the
faces of the musketeers, their bodies, and every object near them, be
tinged with a reddish hue, even the air or cloud of dust; in short, all
that surrounds them. This red tinge you will diminish, in proportion to
their distance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a>
</span> from the primary cause. The groups of figures, which
appear at a distance between the spectator and the light, will form a
dark mass upon a light ground; and their legs will be more undetermined
and lost as they approach nearer to the ground; because there the dust
is heavier and thicker.</p>

<p>If you mean to represent some straggling horses, running out of the main
body, introduce also some small clouds of dust, as far distant from each
other as the leap of the horse, and these little clouds will become
fainter, more scanty, and diffused, in proportion to their distance
from the horse. That nearest to his feet will consequently be the most
determined, smallest, and the thickest of all.</p>

<p>Let the air be full of arrows, in all directions; some ascending, some
falling down, and some darting straight forwards. The bullets of the
musketry, though not seen, will be marked in their course by a train
of smoke, which breaks through the general confusion. The figures in
the fore-ground should have their hair covered with dust, as also their
eyebrows, and all parts liable to receive it.</p>

<p>The victorious party will be running forwards, their hair and other
light parts flying in the wind, their eyebrows lowered, and the motion
of every member properly contrasted; for instance, in moving the right
foot forwards, the left arm must be brought forwards also. If you make
any of them fallen down, mark the trace of his fall on the slippery,
gore-stained dust; and where the ground is less impregnated with blood,
let the print of men&rsquo;s feet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a>
</span> and of horses, that have passed that
way, be marked. Let there be some horses dragging the bodies of their
riders, and leaving behind them a furrow, made by the body thus trailed
along.</p>

<p>The countenances of the vanquished will appear pale and dejected. Their
eyebrows raised, and much wrinkled about the forehead and cheeks. The
tip of their noses somewhat divided from the nostrils by arched wrinkles
terminating at the corner of the eyes, those wrinkles being occasioned
by the opening and raising of the nostrils; the upper lips turned up,
discovering the teeth. Their mouths wide open, and expressive of violent
lamentation. One may be seen fallen wounded on the ground, endeavouring
with one hand to support his body, and covering his eyes with the
other, the palm of which is turned towards the enemy. Others running
away, and with open mouths seeming to cry aloud. Between the legs of
the combatants let the ground be strewed with all sorts of arms; as
broken shields, spears, swords, and the like. Many dead bodies should
be introduced, some entirely covered with dust, others in part only;
let the blood, which seems to issue immediately from the wound, appear
of its natural colour, and running in a winding course, till, mixing
with the dust, it forms a reddish kind of mud. Some should be in the
agonies of death; their teeth shut, their eyes wildly staring, their
fists clenched, and their legs in a distorted position. Some may appear
disarmed, and beaten down by the enemy, still fighting with their fists
and teeth, and endeavouring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a>
</span> to take a passionate, though unavailing
revenge. There may be also a straggling horse without a rider, running
in wild disorder; his mane flying in the wind, beating down with his
feet all before him, and doing a deal of damage. A wounded soldier may
also be seen falling to the ground, and attempting to cover himself with
his shield, while an enemy bending over him endeavours to give him the
finishing stroke. Several dead bodies should be heaped together under a
dead horse. Some of the conquerors, as having ceased fighting, may be
wiping their faces from the dirt, collected on them by the mixture of
dust with the water from their eyes.</p>

<p>The <i>corps de reserve</i> will be seen advancing gaily, but cautiously,
their eyebrows directed forwards, shading their eyes with their hands to
observe the motions of the enemy, amidst clouds of dust and smoke, and
seeming attentive to the orders of their chief. You may also make their
commander holding up his staff, pushing forwards, and pointing towards
the place where they are wanted. A river may likewise be introduced,
with horses fording it, dashing the water about between their legs, and
in the air, covering all the adjacent ground with water and foam. Not a
spot is to be left without some marks of blood and carnage.</p>

<h4><a name="Chap_CLIX" id="Chap_CLIX"></a>
<span class="smcap">Chap. CLIX.</span>&mdash;<i>The Representation of an Orator and his Audience.</i></h4>

<p><span class="smcap">If</span> you have to represent a man who is speaking to a large assembly of
people, you are to consider the subject matter of his discourse, and
to adapt his attitude to such subject. If he means to persuade, let it
be known by his gesture. If he is giving an explanation, deduced from
several reasons, let him put two fingers of the right hand within one of
the left, having the other two bent close, his face turned towards the
audience, with the mouth half open, seeming to speak. If he is sitting,
let him appear as going to raise himself up a little, and his head be
forward. But if he is represented standing, let him bend his chest and
his head forward towards the people.</p>

<p>The auditory are to appear silent and attentive, with their eyes upon
the speaker, in the act of admiration. There should be some old men,
with their mouths close shut, in token of approbation, and their lips
pressed together, so as to form wrinkles at the corners of the mouth,
and about the cheeks, and forming others about the forehead, by raising
the eyebrows, as if struck with astonishment. Some others of those
sitting by, should be seated with their hands within each other, round
one of their knees; some with one knee upon the other, and upon that,
one hand receiving the elbow, the other supporting the chin, covered
with a venerable beard.</p>

be turned towards those to whom he is pointing it out.</p>

admiration, but in various manners. As when the hand of justice punishes
some malefactor. If the subject be an act of devotion, the eyes of
all present should be directed towards the object of their adoration,
aided by a variety of pious actions with the other members; as at the
elevation of the host at mass, and other similar ceremonies. If it be a
laughable subject, or one exciting compassion and moving to tears, in
those cases it will not be necessary for all to have their eyes turned
towards the object, but they will express their feelings by different
actions; and let there be several assembled in groups, to rejoice or
lament together. If the event be terrific, let the faces of those who
run away from the fight, be strongly expressive of fright, with various
motions; as shall be described in the tract on Motion.</p>

<h4><a name="Chap_CLXII" id="Chap_CLXII"></a>
<span class="smcap">Chap. CLXII.</span>&mdash;<i>How to represent Night.</i></h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Those</span> objects which are entirely deprived of light, are lost to the
sight, as in the night; therefore if you mean to paint a history under
those circumstances, you must suppose a large fire, and those objects
that are near it to be tinged with its colour, and the nearer they
are the more they will partake of it. The fire being red, all those
objects which receive light from it will appear of a reddish colour,
and those that are most distant from it will partake of the darkness
that surrounds them. The figures which are represented before the fire
will appear dark in proportion to the brightness of the fire, because
those parts of them which we see, are tinged by that darkness of the
night, and not by the light of the fire, which they intercept. Those
that are on either side of the fire, will be half in the shade of night,
and half in the red light. Those seen beyond the extent of the flames,
will be all of a reddish light upon a black ground. In regard to their
attitudes, let those who are nearest the fire, make screens of their
hands and cloaks, against the scorching heat, with their faces turned on
the contrary side, as if ready to run away from it. The most remote will
only be shading their eyes with their hands, as if hurt by the too great
glare.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I will</span> not omit to introduce among these precepts a new kind of
speculative invention, which though apparently trifling, and almost
laughable, is nevertheless of great utility in assisting the genius to
find variety for composition.</p>

<p>By looking attentively at old and smeared walls, or stones and veined
marble of various colours, you may fancy that you see in them several
compositions, landscapes, battles, figures in quick motion, strange
countenances, and dresses, with an infinity of other objects. By these
confused lines the inventive genius is excited to new exertions.</p>

<h4><a name="Chap_CLXIV" id="Chap_CLXIV"></a>
<span class="smcap">Chap. CLXIV.</span>&mdash;<i>Of Composition in History.</i></h4>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> the painter has only a single figure to represent, he must avoid
any shortening whatever, as well of any particular member, as of the
whole figure, because he would have to contend with the prejudices of
those who have no knowledge in that branch of the art. But in subjects
of history, composed of many figures, shortenings may be introduced
with great propriety, nay, they are indispensable, and ought to be used
without reserve, as the subject may require; particularly in battles,
where of course many shortenings and contortions of figures happen,
amongst such an enraged multitude of actors, possessed, as it were, of a
brutal madness.</p>

thought of a master without a tongue teaching you an art he does not
understand; he will do it better by his expressive motions, than all
the rest by their words and examples. Let then the painter, of whatever
school, attend well to this maxim, and apply it to the different
qualities of the figures he represents, and to the nature of the subject

Laughter, Weeping, Calling out, Singing, either in a high or low pitch,
Admiration, Anger, Joy, Sadness, Fear, Pain, and others, of which I
propose to treat. First, of Laughing and Weeping, which are very similar
in the motion of the mouth, the cheeks, the shutting of the eyebrows,
and the space between them; as we shall explain in its place, in
treating of the changes which happen in the face, hands, fingers, and
all the other parts of the body, as they are affected by the different
emotions of the soul; the knowledge of which is absolutely necessary to
a painter, or else his figures may be said to be twice dead. But it is
very necessary also that he be careful not to fall into the contrary
extreme; giving extraordinary motions to his figures, so that in a quiet
and peaceable subject, he does not seem to represent a battle, or the
revellings of drunken men: but, above all, the actors in any point of
history must be attentive to what they are about, or to what is going
forward; with actions that denote admiration, respect, pain, suspicion,
fear, and joy, according as the occasion, for which they are brought
together, may require. Endeavour that different points of history be not
placed one above the other on the same canvass, nor walls with different
horizons<a name="FNanchor_34_244" id="FNanchor_34_244"></a>

<p><span class="smcap">Between</span> the expression of laughter and that of weeping there is no
difference in the motion of the features either in the eyes, mouth, or
cheeks; only in the ruffling of the brows, which is added when weeping,
but more elevated and extended in laughing. One may represent the figure
weeping as tearing his clothes, or some other expression, as various
as the cause of his feeling may be; because some weep for anger, some
through fear, others for tenderness and joy, or for suspicion; some
for real pain and torment; whilst others weep through compassion, or
regret at the loss of some friend and near relation. These different
feelings will be expressed by some with marks of despair, by others with
moderation; some only shed tears, others cry aloud, while another has
his face turned towards heaven, with his hand depressed, and his fingers
twisted. Some again will be full of apprehension, with their shoulders
raised up to their ears, and so on, according to the above causes.</p>

<p>Those who weep, raise the brows, and bring them close together above
the nose, forming many wrinkles on the forehead, and the corners of the
mouth are turned downwards. Those who laugh have them turned upwards,
and the brows open and extended.</p>

The proof of this is, that the lines may be traced upon a veil or a

that cannot be of any use in shadowing, on account of the infinite
gradation of shades, and the blending of them, which does not allow of
any precise termination; and most frequently they are confused, as will

like a relievo, and some of its parts detached from the ground; he who
excels all others in that part of the art, deserves the greatest praise.
This perfection of the art depends on the correct distribution of lights
and shades, called <i>Chiaro-scuro</i>. If the painter then avoids shadows,
he may be said to avoid the glory of the art, and to render his work
despicable to real connoisseurs, for the sake of acquiring the esteem
of vulgar and ignorant admirers of fine colours, who never have any

<p><span class="smcap">If</span> you wish to make good and useful studies, use great deliberation in
your drawings, observe well among the lights which, and how many, hold
the first rank in point of brightness; and so among the shadows, which
are darker than others, and in what manner they blend together; compare
the quality and quantity of one with the other, and observe to what part
they are directed. Be careful also in your outlines, or divisions of the
members. Remark well what quantity of parts are to be on one side, and<span class="pagenum">
<a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
what on the other; and where they are more or less apparent, or broad,
or slender. Lastly, take care that the shadows and lights be united, or
lost in each other; without any hard strokes, or lines: as smoke loses
itself in the air, so are your lights and shadows to pass from the one
to the other, without any apparent separation.</p>

quickness of execution will come of itself<a name="FNanchor_37_247" id="FNanchor_37_247"></a>

Country, and a different Light.</i></h4>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is a great error in some painters who draw a figure from Nature at
home, by any particular light, and afterwards make use of that drawing
in a picture representing an open country, which receives the general
light of the sky, where the surrounding air gives light on all sides.
This painter would put dark shadows, where Nature would either produce
none, or, if any, so very faint as to be almost imperceptible; and he
would throw reflected lights where it is impossible there should be any.</p>

<span class="smcap">Chap. CLXXXVI.</span>&mdash;<i>How high the Light should be in drawing from

<p><span class="smcap">To</span> paint well from Nature, your window should be to the North, that the
lights may not vary. If it be to the South, you must have paper blinds,
that the sun, in going round, may not alter the shadows. The situation
of the light should be such as to produce upon the ground a shadow from
your model as long as that is high.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> figures which receive a particular light shew more relief than those
which receive an universal one; because the particular light occasions
some reflexes, which proceed from the light of one object upon the
shadows of another, and helps to detach it from the dark ground. But
a figure placed in front of a dark and large space, and receiving a
particular light, can receive no reflexion from any other objects, and
nothing is seen of the figure but what the light strikes on, the rest
being blended and lost in the darkness of the back ground. This is to be
applied only to the imitation of night subjects with very little light.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Be</span> very careful, in painting, to observe, that between the shadows there
are other shadows, almost imperceptible, both for darkness and shape;
and this is proved by the third proposition<a name="FNanchor_38_248" id="FNanchor_38_248"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_38_248" class="fnanchor">[38]</a>, which says, that the

<h4><a name="Chap_CLXXXIX" id="Chap_CLXXXIX"></a>
<span class="smcap">Chap. CLXXXIX.</span>&mdash;<i>Of Shadows.</i></h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Those</span> shadows which in Nature are undetermined, and the extremities of
which can hardly be perceived, are to be copied in your painting in
the same manner, never to be precisely finished, but left confused and
blended. This apparent neglect will shew great judgment, and be the
ingenious result of your observation of Nature.</p>

<h4><a name="Chap_CXC" id="Chap_CXC"></a>
<span class="smcap">Chap. CXC.</span>&mdash;<i>Of the Kind of Light proper for drawing from
Relievos, or from Nature.</i></h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Lights</span> separated from the shadows with too much precision, have a
very bad effect. In order, therefore, to avoid this inconvenience,
if the object be in the open country, you need not let your figures
be illumined by the sun; but may suppose some transparent clouds
interposed, so that the sun not being visible, the termination of the
shadows will be also imperceptible and soft.</p>

<h4><a name="Chap_CXCI" id="Chap_CXCI"></a>
<span class="smcap">Chap. CXCI.</span>&mdash;<i>Whether the Light should be admitted in Front or
sideways; and which is most pleasing and graceful.</i></h4>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> light admitted in front of heads situated opposite to side walls
that are dark, will cause them to have great relievo, particularly if
the light be placed high; and the reason is, that the most prominent
parts of those faces are illumined by the general light striking them
in front, which light produces very<span class="pagenum">
<a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span> faint shadows on the part where it
strikes; but as it turns towards the sides, it begins to participate
of the dark shadows of the room, which grow darker in proportion as
it sinks into them. Besides, when the light comes from on high, it
does not strike on every part of the face alike, but one part produces
great shadows upon another; as the eyebrows, which deprive the whole
sockets of the eyes of light. The nose keeps it off from great part of
the mouth, and the chin from the neck, and such other parts. This, by
concentrating the light upon the most projecting parts, produces a very
great relief.</p>

<h4><a name="Chap_CXCII" id="Chap_CXCII"></a>
<span class="smcap">Chap. CXCII.</span>&mdash;<i>Of the Difference of Lights according to the
Situation.</i></h4>

<p><span class="smcap">A small</span> light will cast large and determined shadows upon the
surrounding bodies. A large light, on the contrary, will cast small
shadows on them, and they will be much confused in their termination.
When a small but strong light is surrounded by a broad but weaker light,
the latter will appear like a demi-tint to the other, as the sky round
the sun. And the bodies which receive the light from the one, will serve
as demi-tints to those which receive the light from the other.</p>

<h4><a name="Chap_CXCIII" id="Chap_CXCIII"></a>
<span class="smcap">Chap. CXCIII.</span>&mdash;<i>How to distribute the Light on Figures.</i></h4>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> lights are to be distributed according to the natural situation you
mean your figures should occupy. If you suppose them in sunshine, the
shades must be dark, the lights broad and extended, and<span class="pagenum">
<a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span> the shadows of
all the surrounding objects distinctly marked upon the ground. If seen
in a gloomy day, there will be very little difference between the lights
and shades, and no shadows at the feet. If the figures be represented
within doors, the lights and shadows will again be distinctly divided,
and produce shadows on the ground. But if you suppose a paper blind at
the window, and the walls painted white, the effect will be the same as
in a gloomy day, when the lights and shadows have little difference.
If the figures are enlightened by the fire, the lights must be red and
powerful, the shadows dark, and the shadows upon the ground and upon
the walls must be precise; observing that they spread wider as they go
off from the body. If the figures be enlightened, partly by the sky and
partly by the fire, that side which receives the light from the sky will
be the brightest, and on the other side it will be reddish, somewhat of
the colour of the fire. Above all, contrive, that your figures receive a
broad light, and that from above; particularly in portraits, because the
people we see in the street receive all the light from above; and it is
curious to observe, that there is not a face ever so well known amongst
your acquaintance, but would be recognised with difficulty, if it were
enlightened from beneath.</p>

<span class="smcap">Chap. CXCV.</span>&mdash;<i>How, in drawing a Face, to give it Grace, by the
Management of Light and Shade.</i></h4>

<p><span class="smcap">A face</span> placed in the dark part of a room, acquires great additional
grace by means of light and shadow. The shadowed part of the face blends
with the darkness of the ground, and the light part receives an increase
of brightness from the open air, the shadows on this side becoming
almost insensible; and from this augmentation of light and shadow, the
face has much relief, and acquires great beauty.</p>

<h4><a name="Chap_CXCVI" id="Chap_CXCVI"></a>
<span class="smcap">Chap. CXCVI.</span>&mdash;<i>How to give Grace and Relief to Faces.</i></h4>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> streets running towards the west, when the sun is in the meridian,
and the walls on each side so high that they cast no reflexions on that
side of the bodies which is in shade, and the sky is not too bright,
we find the most advantageous situation for giving relief and grace to
figures, particularly to faces; because both sides of the face will
participate of the shadows of the walls. The sides of the nose and the
face towards the west, will be light, and the man whom we suppose placed
at the entrance, and in the middle of the street, will see all the parts
of that face, which are before him, perfectly illumined, while both
sides of it, towards the walls, will be in shadow. What gives additional
grace is, that these shades do not appear cutting, hard, or dry, but
softly blended and lost in each other. The reason of it is,<span class="pagenum">
<a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span> that the
light which is spread all over in the air, strikes also the pavement of
the street, and reflecting upon the shady part of the face, it tinges
that slightly with the same hue: while the great light which comes from
above being confined by the tops of houses, strikes on the face from
different points, almost to the very beginning of the shadows under the
projecting parts of the face. It diminishes by degrees the strength
of them, increasing the light till it comes upon the chin, where it
terminates, and loses itself, blending softly into the shades on all
sides. For instance, if such light were A E, the line F E would give
light even to the bottom of the nose. The line C F will give light only
to the under lip; but the line A H would extend the shadow to all the
under parts of the face, and under the chin.</p>

<p class="bottom1">In this situation the nose receives a very strong light from all the
points A B C D E.</p>

these different objects ought to be darker in proportion as they are
lower, and as they are nearer the middle of the groups, though they are
all of an uniform colour. This is necessary, because a smaller portion
of the sky (from which all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a>
</span> bodies are illuminated) can give light to
the lower spaces between these different figures, than to the upper
parts of the spaces. It is proved thus: A B C D is that portion of the
sky which gives light to all the objects beneath; M and N are the bodies
which occupy the space S T R H, in which it is evidently perceived, that
the point F, receiving the light only from the portion of the sky C D,
has a smaller quantity of it than the point E which receives it from
the whole space A B (a larger portion than C D); therefore it will be
lighter in E than in F.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> neck, or any other part which is raised straight upwards, and has a
projection over it, will be darker than the perpendicular front of that
projection; and this projecting part will be lighter, in proportion as
it presents a larger surface to the light. For instance, the recess A
receives no light from any part of the sky G K, but B begins to receive
the light from the part of the sky H K, and C from G K; and the point D
receives the whole of F K. Therefore the chest will be as light as the
forehead, nose, and chin. But what I have particularly to recommend, in
regard to faces, is, that you observe well those different qualities of
shades which are lost at different distances (while there remain only
the first and principal spots or strokes of shades, such as those of the
sockets of the eyes, and other similar recesses, which are always dark),
and at last the whole face becomes obscured; because the greatest lights
(being small in proportion to the demi-tints) are lost. The quality,
therefore, and quantity of the principal<span class="pagenum">
<a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span> lights and shades are by means
of great distance blended together into a general half-tint; and this
is the reason why trees and other objects are found to be in appearance
darker at some distance than they are in reality, when nearer to the
eye. But then the air, which interposes between the objects and the eye,
will render them light again by tinging them with azure, rather in the
shades than in the lights; for the lights will preserve the truth of the
different colours much longer.</p>

and, on the contrary, darker upon a light ground. This we learn from
observing snow as it falls; while it is descending it appears darker
against the sky, than when we see it against an open window, which
(owing to the darkness of the inside of the house) makes it appear very
white. Observe also, that snow appears to fall very quick and in a great
quantity when near the eye; but when at some distance, it seems to come
down slowly, and in a smaller quantity<a name="FNanchor_47_257" id="FNanchor_47_257"></a>

<p><span class="smcap">Reverberations</span> are produced by all bodies of a bright nature, that have
a smooth and tolerably hard surface, which, repelling the light it
receives, makes it rebound like a foot-ball against the first object
opposed to it.</p>

<h4><a name="Chap_CCXIV" id="Chap_CCXIV"></a>
<span class="smcap">Chap. CCXIV.</span>&mdash;<i>Where there cannot be any Reverberation of
Light.</i></h4>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> surfaces of hard bodies are surrounded by various qualities of light
and shadow. The lights are of two sorts; one is called original, the
other derivative. The original light is that which comes from the sun,
or the brightness of fire, or else from the air. The derivative is a
reflected light. But to return to our definition, I say, there can be
no reflexion on that side which is turned towards any dark body; such
as roofs, either high or low, shrubs, grass, wood, either dry or green;
because, though every individual part of those objects be turned towards
the original light, and struck by it; yet the quantity of shadow which
every one of these parts produces upon the others, is so great, that,
upon the whole, the light, not forming a compact mass, loses its effect,
so that those objects cannot reflect any light upon the opposite bodies.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> reflected lights will be more or less apparent or bright, in
proportion as they are seen against a darker or fainter ground; because
if the ground be darker than the reflex, then this reflex will appear
stronger on account of the great difference of colour. But, on the
contrary, if this reflexion has behind it a ground lighter than itself,
it will appear dark, in comparison to the brightness which is close to
it, and therefore it will be hardly perceptible<a name="FNanchor_48_258" id="FNanchor_48_258"></a>

brighten up or lessen their obscurity in proportion to the strength
of those lights, and their proximity to those shadows. Many painters
neglect this observation, while others attend to and deduce their
practice from it. This difference of opinion and practice divides the
sentiments of artists, so that they blame each other for not thinking
and acting as they themselves do. The best way is to steer a middle
course, and not to admit of any reflected light, but when the cause of
it is evident to every eye; and <i>vice vers√¢</i>, if you introduce none at
all, let it appear evident that there was no reasonable cause for it. In
doing so, you will neither be totally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112"

of opinion, which, if not proceeding from entire ignorance, will ensure

that which is upon a lighter ground will be less apparent. And this

dark ones appear still darker; so in contrasted lights, the brightest

E at the base will not be reflected by equal angles, as it is evident
that the angle E A B is more obtuse than the angle E B A. The angle
A F B however, though it is between angles of less quality than the
angle E, and has a common base B A, is between angles more nearly equal
than E, therefore it will be lighter in F than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113"

<span class="smcap">Chap. CCXXVI.</span>&mdash;<i>Of the Mixture of Colours.</i></h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Although</span> the mixture of colours may be extended to an infinite variety,
almost impossible to be described, I will not omit touching slightly
upon it, setting down at first a certain number of simple colours to
serve as a foundation, and with each of these mixing one of the others;
one with one, then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a>
</span> two with two, and three with three, proceeding in
this manner to the full mixture of all the colors together: then I would
begin again, mixing two of these colours with two others, and three with
three, four with four, and so on to the end. To these two colours we
shall put three; to these three add three more, and then six, increasing
always in the same proportion.</p>

<p>I call those simple colours, which are not composed, and cannot be made
or supplied by any mixture of other colours. Black and White are not
reckoned among colours; the one is the representative of darkness, the
other of light: that is, one is a simple privation of light, the other
is light itself. Yet I will not omit mentioning them, because there is
nothing in painting more useful and necessary; since painting is but an
effect produced by lights and shadows, viz. <i>chiaro-scuro</i>. After Black
and White come Blue and Yellow, then Green, and Tawny or Umber, and then
Purple and Red. These eight colours are all that Nature produces. With
these I begin my mixtures, first Black and White, Black and Yellow,
Black and Red; then Yellow and Red: but I shall treat more at length of
these mixtures in a separate work<a name="FNanchor_52_262" id="FNanchor_52_262"></a>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> first of all simple colours is White, though philosophers will not
acknowledge either White or Black to be colours; because the first is
the cause, or the receiver of colours, the other totally deprived of
them. But as painters cannot do without either, we shall place them
among the others; and according to this order of things, White will
be the first, Yellow the second, Green the third, Blue the fourth,
Red the fifth, and Black the sixth. We shall set down White for the
representative of light, without which no colour can be seen; Yellow for
the earth; Green for water; Blue for air; Red for fire; and Black for
total darkness.</p>

<p>If you wish to see by a short process the variety of all the mixed, or
composed colours, take some coloured glasses, and, through them, look
at all the country round: you will find that the colour of each object
will be altered and mixed with the colour of the glass through which it
is seen; observe which colour is made better, and which is hurt by the
mixture. If the glass be yellow, the colour of the objects may either
be improved, or greatly impaired by it. Black and White will be most
altered, while Green and Yellow will be meliorated. In the same manner
you may go through all the mixtures of colours, which are infinite.
Select those which are new and agreeable to the sight; and following
the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a>

used, and the part finished, you may then glaze it thinly with this
dissolved Aloe, and it will produce a very fine colour. This Aloe may
be ground also in oil by itself, or with the Verdegris, or any other
colour, at pleasure.</p>

apply the coat of white and Naples yellow, and all the rest as before.

lake, and Naples yellow. The shades with black, umber, and a little
lake; you may, if you please, use black chalk. After you have softened
this first coat, or dead colour, and let it dry, you may retouch over it
with lake and other colours, and gum water that has been a long while
made and kept liquid, because in that state it becomes better, and does
not leave any gloss. Again, to make the shades darker, take the lake and
gum as above, and ink<a name="FNanchor_55_265" id="FNanchor_55_265"></a>

beauty, as they are more or less immersed in the shade. But colours
situated in a light space will shew their natural beauty in proportion
to the brightness of that light. Some say,<span class="pagenum">
<a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span> that there is as great
variety in the colours of shadows, as in the colours of objects shaded
by them. It may be answered, that colours placed in shadow will shew
less variety amongst themselves as the shadows are darker. We shall
soon convince ourselves of this truth, if, from a large square, we look
through the open door of a church, where pictures, though enriched with
a variety of colours, appear all clothed in darkness.</p>

<span class="smcap">Chap. CCXLIII.</span>&mdash;<i>Whether it be possible for all Colours to
appear alike by means of the same Shadow.</i></h4>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is very possible that all the different colours may be changed into
that of a general shadow; as is manifest in the darkness of a cloudy
night, in which neither the shape nor colour of bodies is distinguished.
Total darkness being nothing but a privation of the primitive and
reflected lights, by which the form and colour of bodies are seen; it is
evident, that the cause being removed the effect ceases, and the objects
are entirely lost to the sight.</p>

<h4><a name="Chap_CCXLIV" id="Chap_CCXLIV"></a>
<span class="smcap">Chap. CCXLIV.</span>&mdash;<i>Why White is not reckoned among the Colours.</i></h4>

<p><span class="smcap">White</span> is not a colour, but has the power of receiving all the other
colours. When it is placed in a high situation in the country, all its
shades are azure; according to the fourth proposition<a name="FNanchor_59_269"
id="FNanchor_59_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_269" class="fnanchor">[59]</a>, which<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span> says,
that the surface of any opake body participates of the colour of any
other body sending the light to it. Therefore white being deprived of
the light of the sun by the interposition of any other body, will remain
white; if exposed to the sun on one side, and to the open air on the
other, it will participate both of the colour of the sun and of the air.
That side which is not opposed to the sun, will be shaded of the colour
of the air. And if this white were not surrounded by green fields all
the way to the horizon, nor could receive any light from that horizon,
without doubt it would appear of one simple and uniform colour, viz.
that of the air.</p>

<span class="smcap">Chap. CCXLV.</span>&mdash;<i>Of Colours.</i></h4>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> light of the fire tinges every thing of a reddish yellow; but this
will hardly appear evident, if we do not make the comparison with the
daylight. Towards the close of the evening this is easily done; but more
certainly after the morning twilight; and the difference will be clearly
distinguished in a dark room, when a little glimpse of daylight strikes
upon any part of the room, and there still remains a candle burning.
Without such a trial the difference is hardly perceivable, particularly
in those colours which have most similarity; such as white and yellow,
light green and light blue; because the light which strikes the blue,
being yellow, will naturally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a>
</span> turn it green; as we have said in another
place<a name="FNanchor_60_270" id="FNanchor_60_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_270"
class="fnanchor">[60]</a>, that a mixture of blue and yellow produces green. And if to
a green colour you add some yellow, it will make it of a more beautiful
green.</p>

<span class="smcap">Chap. CCXLVI.</span>&mdash;<i>Of the Colouring of remote Objects.</i></h4>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> painter, who is to represent objects at some distance from the eye,
ought merely to convey the idea of general undetermined masses, making
choice, for that purpose, of cloudy weather, or towards the evening, and
avoiding, as was said before, to mark the lights and shadows too strong
on the extremities; because they would in that case appear like spots of
difficult execution, and without grace. He ought to remember, that the
shadows are never to be of such a quality, as to obliterate the proper
colour, in which they originated; if the situation of the coloured body
be not in total darkness. He ought to mark no outline, not to make the
hair stringy, and not to touch with pure white, any but those things
which in themselves are white; in short, the lightest touch upon any
particular object ought to denote the beauty of its proper and natural
colour.</p>

<h4><a name="Chap_CCXLVII" id="Chap_CCXLVII"></a>
<span class="smcap">Chap. CCXLVII.</span>&mdash;<i>The Surface of all opake Bodies participates

<p class="bottom1"><span class="smcap">The</span> painter ought to know, that if any white object is placed between
two walls, one of which is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a>
</span> also white, and the other black, there will
be found between the shady side of that object and the light side, a
similar proportion to that of the two walls; and if that object be
blue, the effect will be the same. Having therefore to paint this
object, take some black, similar to that of the wall from which the
reflexes come; and to proceed by a certain and scientific method, do as
follows. When you paint the wall, take a small spoon to measure exactly
the quantity of colour you mean to employ in mixing your tints; for
instance, if you have put in the shading of this wall three spoonfuls
of pure black, and one of white, you have, without any doubt, a mixture
of a certain and precise quality. Now having painted one of the walls
white, and the other dark, if you mean to place a blue object between
them with shades suitable to that colour, place first on your pallet the
light blue, such as you mean it to be, without any mixture of shade,
and it will do for the lightest part of your object. After which take
three spoonfuls of black, and one of this light blue, for your darkest
shades. Then observe whether your object be round or square: if it be
square, these two extreme tints of light and shade will be close to each
other, cutting sharply at the angle; but if it be round, draw lines
from the extremities of the walls to the centre of the object, and put
the darkest shade between equal angles, where the lines intersect upon
the superficies of it; then begin to make them lighter and<span class="pagenum">
<a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span> lighter
gradually to the point N O, lessening the strength of the shadows as
much as that place participates of the light A D, and mixing that colour
with the darkest shade A B, in the same proportion.</p>

<span class="smcap">Chap. CCXLVIII.</span>&mdash;<i>General Remarks on Colours.</i></h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Blue</span> and green are not simple colours in their nature, for blue is
composed of light and darkness; such is the azure of the sky, viz.
perfect black and perfect white. Green is composed of a simple and a
mixed colour, being produced by blue and yellow.</p>

<p>Any object seen in a mirror, will participate of the colour of that body
which serves as a mirror; and the mirror in its turn is tinged in part
by the colour of the object it represents; they partake more or less of
each other as the colour of the object seen is more or less strong than
the colour of the mirror. That object will appear of the strongest and
most lively colour in the mirror, which has the most affinity to the
colour of the mirror itself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span></p>

<p>Of coloured bodies, the purest white will be seen at the greatest
distance, therefore the darker the colour, the less it will bear
distance.</p>

<p>Of different bodies equal in whiteness, and in distance from the eye,
that which is surrounded by the greatest darkness will appear the
whitest; and on the contrary, that shadow will appear the darkest that
has the brightest white round it.</p>

<p>Of different colours, equally perfect, that will appear most excellent,
which is seen near its direct contrary. A pale colour against red, a
black upon white (though neither the one nor the other are colours),
blue near a yellow; green near red; because each colour is more
distinctly seen, when opposed to its contrary, than to any other similar
to it.</p>

<p>Any thing white seen in a dense air full of vapours, will appear larger
than it is in reality.</p>

<p>The air, between the eye and the object seen, will change the colour
of that object into its own; so will the azure of the air change the
distant mountains into blue masses. Through a red glass every thing
appears red; the light round the stars is dimmed by the darkness of the
air, which fills the space between the eye and the planets.</p>

<p>The true colour of any object whatever will be seen in those parts which
are not occupied by any kind of shade, and have not any gloss (if it be
a polished surface).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span></p>

<p>I say, that white terminating abruptly upon a dark ground, will cause
that part where it terminates to appear darker, and the white whiter.</p>

<h4><a name="Chap_CCLII" id="Chap_CCLII"></a>
<span class="smcap">Chap. CCLII.</span>&mdash;<i>Of the Shadows of White.</i></h4>

<p><span class="smcap">To</span> any white body receiving the light from the sun, or the air, the
shadows should be of a blueish cast; because white is no colour, but a
receiver of all colours; and as by the fourth proposition<a name="FNanchor_61_271"
id="FNanchor_61_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_271" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> we learn,
that the surface of any object participates of the colours of other

<p><span class="smcap">That</span> shade will be the darkest which is produced by the whitest surface;
this also will have a greater propensity to variety than any other
surface; because white is not properly a colour, but a receiver of
colours, and its surface will participate strongly of the colour of
surrounding objects, but principally of black or any other dark colour,
which being the most opposite to its nature, produces the most sensible
difference between the shadows and the lights.</p>

of these two bodies will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a>
</span> be either alike or not. If they be alike, that
object which of the two is nearest to the eye, should be made a little
darker than the other, upon the rounding of the outline; but if the
object which serves as a ground to the other be not quite so white, the
latter will detach of itself, without the help of any darker termination.</p>

<span class="smcap">Chap. CCLV.</span>&mdash;<i>On the Back-grounds of Figures.</i></h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Of</span> two objects equally light, one will appear less so if seen upon a
whiter ground; and, on the contrary, it will appear a great deal lighter
if upon a space of a darker shade. So flesh colour will appear pale upon
a red ground, and a pale colour will appear redder upon a yellow ground.
In short, colours will appear what they are not, according to the ground
which surrounds them.</p>

according to the second proposition<a name="FNanchor_62_272" id="FNanchor_62_272"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_62_272" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> of the third book, which<span class="pagenum">
<a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span> says,
that colour will be seen in the greatest perfection which has less air
interposed between it and the eye of the beholder; and for that reason
the shadows (by which we express the relievo of bodies) appear darker
when near than when at a distance, being then deadened by the air which
interposes. This does not happen to those shadows which are near the
eye, where they will produce the greatest relievo when they are darkest.</p>

<h4><a name="Chap_CCLVII" id="Chap_CCLVII"></a>
<span class="smcap">Chap. CCLVII.</span>&mdash;<i>Remarks concerning Lights and Shadows.</i></h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Observe</span>, that where the shadows end, there be always a kind of
half-shadow to blend them with the lights. The shadow derived from any
object will mix more with the light at its termination, in proportion as
it is more distant from that object. But the colour of the shadow will
never be simple: this is proved by the ninth proposition<a name="FNanchor_63_273"
id="FNanchor_63_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_273" class="fnanchor">[63]</a>, which
says, that the superficies of any object participates of the colours of
other bodies, by which it is surrounded, although it were transparent,
such as water, air, and the like: because the air receives its light
from the sun, and darkness is produced by the privation of it. But as
the air has no colour in itself any more than water, it receives all the
colours that are between the object<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136"
id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span> and the eye. The vapours mixing
with the air in the lower regions near the earth, render it thick, and
apt to reflect the sun&rsquo;s rays on all sides, while the air above remains
dark; and because light (that is, white) and darkness (that is, black),
mixed together, compose the azure that becomes the colour of the sky,
which is lighter or darker in proportion as the air is more or less
mixed with damp vapours.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> shadows of bodies produced by the redness of the setting sun,
will always be blueish. This is accounted for by the eleventh
proposition<a name="FNanchor_64_274" id="FNanchor_64_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_274"
class="fnanchor">[64]</a>, which says, that the superficies of any opake body
participates of the colour of the object from which it receives the
light; therefore the white wall being deprived entirely of colour, is
tinged by the colour of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a>
</span> those bodies from which it receives the light,
which in this case are the sun and the sky. But because the sun is red
towards the evening, and the sky is blue, the shadow on the wall not
being enlightened by the sun, receives only the reflexion of the sky,
and therefore will appear blue; and the rest of the wall, receiving
light immediately from the sun, will participate of its red colour.</p>

<h4><a name="Chap_CCLIX" id="Chap_CCLIX"></a>
<span class="smcap">Chap. CCLIX.</span>&mdash;<i>Of the Colour of Faces.</i></h4>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> colour of any object will appear more or less distinct in proportion
to the extent of its surface. This proportion is proved, by observing
that a face appears dark at a small distance, because, being composed of
many small parts, it produces a great number of shadows; and the lights
being the smallest part of it, are soonest lost to the sight, leaving
only the shadows, which being in a greater quantity, the whole of the
face appears dark, and the more so if that face has on the head, or at
the back, something whiter.</p>

<h4><a name="Chap_CCLX" id="Chap_CCLX"></a>
<span class="smcap">Chap. CCLX.</span>&mdash;<i>A Precept relating to Painting.</i></h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Where</span> the shadows terminate upon the lights, observe well what parts
of them are lighter than the others, and where they are more or less
softened and blended; but above all remember, that young people have
no sharp shadings: their flesh is transparent, something like what we
observe when we put our hand between the sun and eyes; it appears<span class="pagenum">
<a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
reddish, and of a transparent brightness. If you wish to know what
kind of shadow will suit the flesh colour you are painting, place one
of your fingers close to your picture, so as to cast a shadow upon it,
and according as you wish it either lighter or darker, put it nearer or
farther from it, and imitate it.</p>

<h4><a name="Chap_CCLXI" id="Chap_CCLXI"></a>
<span class="smcap">Chap. CCLXI.</span>&mdash;<i>Of Colours in Shadow.</i></h4>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> happens very often that the shadows of an opake body do not retain
the same colour as the lights. Sometimes they will be greenish, while
the lights are reddish, although this opake body be all over of one
uniform colour. This happens when the light falls upon the object (we
will suppose from the East), and tinges that side with its own colour.
In the West we will suppose another opake body of a colour different
from the first, but receiving the same light. This last will reflect
its colour towards the East, and strike the first with its rays on the
opposite side, where they will be stopped, and remain with their full
colour and brightness. We often see a white object with red lights, and
the shades of a blueish cast; this we observe particularly in mountains
covered with snow, at sun-set, when the effulgence of its rays makes the
horizon appear all on fire.</p>

<h4><a name="Chap_CCLXII" id="Chap_CCLXII"></a>
<span class="smcap">Chap. CCLXII.</span>&mdash;<i>Of the Choice of Lights.</i></h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Whatever</span> object you intend to represent is to be supposed situated in
a particular light, and that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a>
</span> entirely of your own choosing. If you
imagine such objects to be in the country, and the sun be overcast,
they will be surrounded by a great quantity of general light. If the
sun strikes upon those objects, then the shadows will be very dark,
in proportion to the lights, and will be determined and sharp; the
primitive as well as the secondary ones. These shadows will vary from
the lights in colour, because on that side the object receives a
reflected light hue from the azure of the air, which tinges that part;
and this is particularly observable in white objects. That side which
receives the light from the sun, participates also of the colour of
that. This may be particularly observed in the evening, when the sun
is setting between the clouds, which it reddens; those clouds being
tinged with the colour of the body illuminating them, the red colour
of the clouds, with that of the sun, casts a hue on those parts which
receive the light from them. On the contrary, those parts which are not
turned towards that side of the sky, remain of the colour of the air,
so that the former and the latter are of two different colours. This
we must not lose sight of, that, knowing the cause of those lights and
shades, it be made apparent in the effect, or else the work will be
false and absurd. But if a figure be situated within a house, and seen
from without, such figure will have its shadows very soft; and if the
beholder stands in the line of the light, it will acquire grace, and do
credit to the painter, as it will have great relief in the lights, and
soft and <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a>
</span>well-blended shadows, particularly in those parts where the
inside of the room appears less obscure, because there the shadows are
almost imperceptible: the cause of which we shall explain in its proper
place.</p>

<p>The boundaries which separate one body from another, are of the nature
of mathematical lines, but not of real lines. The end of any colour
is only the beginning of another, and it ought not to be called a
line, for nothing interposes between them, except the termination of
the one against the other, which being nothing in itself, cannot be

<p><span class="smcap">One</span> of the principal parts of painting is the nature and quality of
back-grounds, upon which the extremities of any convex or solid body
will always detach and be distinguished in nature, though the colour of
such objects, and that of the ground, be exactly the same. This happens,
because the convex sides of solid bodies do not receive the light in the
same manner with the ground, for such sides or extremities are often
lighter or darker than the ground. But if such extremities were to be
of the same colour as the ground, and in the same degree of light,
they certainly could not be distinguished. Therefore such a choice in
painting ought to be avoided by all intelligent and judicious painters;
since the intention is to make the objects appear as it were out of the
ground. The above case would produce the contrary effect, not only in
painting, but also in objects of real relievo.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">What</span> is fine is not always beautiful and good: I address this to such
painters as are so attached to the beauty of colours, that they regret
being obliged to give them almost imperceptible shadows, not considering
the beautiful relief which figures acquire by a proper gradation and
strength of shadows. Such persons may be compared to those speakers
who in conversation make use of many fine words without meaning, which

they may add Beauty to each other.</i></h4>

<p><span class="smcap">If</span> you mean that the proximity of one colour should give beauty to
another that terminates near it, observe the rays of the sun in the
composition of the rainbow, the colours of which are generated by the
falling rain, when each drop in its descent takes every colour of that
bow, as is demonstrated in its place<a name="FNanchor_65_275" id="FNanchor_65_275"></a>

<p>If you mean to represent great darkness, it must be done by contrasting
it with great light; on the contrary, if you want to produce great
brightness, you must oppose to it a very dark shade: so a pale yellow
will cause red to appear more beautiful than if opposed to a purple
colour.</p>

<p>There is another rule, by observing which, though you do not increase
the natural beauty of the colours, yet by bringing them together they
may give additional grace to each other, as green placed near red, while
the effect would be quite the reverse, if placed near blue.</p>

<p>Harmony and grace are also produced by a judicious arrangement of
colours, such as blue with pale yellow or white, and the like; as will
be noticed in its place.</p>

that which reflects the light blue, the part reflected will be green,

the blue colour B be reflected on the same place. I say that a mixture

large, it prevents the variety of colours in smaller objects round it,
from interfering with, and discomposing the principal colour, which
is nearer. Nevertheless it does not prevent its participating more of
the colour of a small object near it, than of a large one more remote.

light at the same time to an infinity of atoms floating in this air,
renders it more sensible to the eye. So that the air will appear lighter

is proved by the seventh proposition<a name="FNanchor_71_281" id="FNanchor_71_281"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_71_281" class="fnanchor">[71]</a>, which says, the air is more
or less pure, as it is near to, or remote from the earth. If the eye
then, and the object are near the earth, the thickness of the air which
interposes, will in a great measure confuse the colour of that object to
the eye. But if the eye and the object are placed high above the earth,
the air will disturb the natural colour of that object very little. In
short, the various gradations of colour depend not only on the various
distances, in which they may be lost; but also on the variety of lights,
which change according to the different hours of the day, and the
thickness or purity of the air, through which the colour of the object
is conveyed to the eye.</p>

gloss, being the smallest part of it, as a light within a light. The

taste, or colour, but is easily impregnated with the quality of other
matter surrounding it; and will appear bluer in proportion to the
darkness of the space behind it, as may be observed against the shady
sides of mountains, which are darker than any other object. In this

The first, E, is placed at two degrees of distance from the eye A; the
second, B, shall be four degrees, the third, C, six degrees, and the
fourth, D, eight degrees; as appears by the circles which terminate upon
and intersect the line A R. Let us suppose that the space A R, S P, is
one degree of thin air, and S P E T another degree of thicker air. It
will follow, that the first colour, E, will pass to the eye through one
degree of thick air, E S, and through another degree, S A, of thinner
air. And B will send its colour to the eye in A, through two degrees of
thick air, and through two others of the thinner sort. C will send it
through three degrees<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a>

D goes through four degrees of the one, and four of the other. This

acquire one degree upon the distance. And when the air still higher
shall have lost two degrees of thickness, the colour will acquire as
many upon the distance; and in that case the colour will be the same
at three degrees as at one. But to be brief, if the colour be raised
so high as to enter that quality of air which has lost three degrees
of thickness, and acquired three degrees of distance, then you may be
certain that that colour which is high and remote, has lost no more than
the colour which is below and nearer; because in rising it has acquired
those three degrees which it was losing by the same distance from the
eye; and this is what was meant to be proved.</p>

removed double the distance it was at before, viz. at two degrees of
distance, A F and F G, from the eye; and it will be placed in G. If that
is raised to the second degree of air A M N L, and to the degree O M, P
N, it will necessarily be placed at E, and will be removed from the eye
the whole length of the line A E, which will be proved in this manner
to be equal in thickness to the distance A G. If in the same quality of
air the distance A G interposed between the eye and the colour occupies
two degrees, and A E occupies two degrees and a half, it is sufficient
to preserve the colour G, when raised to E, from any change, because the
degree A C and the degree A F being the same in thickness, are equal
and alike, and the degree C D, though equal in length to the degree F
G, is not alike in point of thickness of air; because half of it is
situated in a degree of air of double the thickness of the air above:
this half degree of distance occupies as much of the colour as one
whole degree of the air above would, which air above is twice as thin
as the air below, with which it terminates; so that by calculating the
thickness of the air, and the distances, you will find that the colours
have changed places without undergoing any alteration in their beauty.
And we shall prove it thus: reckoning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161"
id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span> first the thickness of air, the
colour H is placed in four degrees of thickness, the colour G in two
degrees, and E at one degree. Now let us see whether the distances are
in an equal inverse proportion; the colour E is at two degrees and a
half of distance, G at two degrees, and H at one degree. But as this
distance has not an exact proportion with the thickness of air, it is
necessary to make a third calculation in this manner: A C is perfectly
like and equal to A F; the half degree, C B, is like but not equal to A
F, because it is only half a degree in length, which is equal to a whole
degree of the quality of the air above; so that by this calculation we
shall solve the question. For A C is equal to two degrees of thickness
of the air above, and the half degree C B is equal to a whole degree of
the same air above; and one degree more is to be taken in, viz. B E,
which makes the fourth. A H has four degrees of thickness of air, A G
also four, viz. A F two in value, and F G also two, which taken together
make four. A E has also four, because A C contains two, and C D one,
which is the half of A C, and in the same quality of air; and there is
a whole degree above in the thin air, which all together make four. So
that if A E is not double the distance A G, nor four times the distance
A H, it is made equivalent by the half degree C B of thick air, which is
equal to a whole degree of thin air above. This proves the truth of the
proposition, that the colour H G E does not undergo any alteration by
these different distances.</p>

distant.</p>

<p>It is said, that, in a landscape, trees of the same species appear
darker in the distance than near; this cannot be true, if they be of
equal size, and divided by equal spaces. But it will be so if the
first trees are scattered, and the light of the fields is seen through
and between them, while the others which are farther off, are thick
together, as is often the case near some river or other piece of water:
in this case no space of light fields can be perceived, but the trees
appear thick together, accumulating the shadow on each other. It also
happens, that as the shady parts of plants are much broader than the
light ones, the colour of the plants becoming darker by the multiplied
shadows, is preserved, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> darker the mountain is in itself, the bluer it will appear at a
great distance. The highest part will be the darkest, as being more
woody; because woods cover a great many shrubs, and other plants,
which never receive any light. The wild plants of those woods are also
naturally of a darker hue than cultivated plants; for oak, beech, fir,
cypress, and pine trees are much darker than olive and other domestic
plants. Near the top of these mountains, where the air is thinner and
purer, the darkness of the woods will make it appear of a deeper azure,
than at the bottom, where the air is thicker. A plant will detach very
little from the ground it stands upon, if that ground be of a colour
something similar to its own; and, <i>vice vers√¢</i>, that part of any white
object which is nearest to a dark one, will appear the whitest, and
the less so as it is removed from it; and any dark object will appear
darker, the nearer it is to a white one; and less so, if removed from it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> are some situations which, though light, appear dark, and in
which objects are deprived both<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a>
</span> of form and colour. This is caused by
the great light which pervades the intervening air; as is observable
by looking in through a window at some distance from the eye, when
nothing is seen but an uniform darkish shade; but if we enter the house,
we shall find that room to be full of light, and soon distinguish
every small object contained within that window. This difference of
effect is produced by the great brightness of the air, which contracts
considerably the pupil of the eye, and by so doing diminishes its
power. But in dark places the pupil is enlarged, and acquires as much
in strength, as it increases in size. This is proved in my second
proposition of perspective<a name="FNanchor_73_283" id="FNanchor_73_283"></a>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> termination and shape of the parts in general are very little seen,
either in great masses of light, or of shadows; but those which are
situated between the extremes of light and shade are the most distinct.</p>

<p>Perspective, as far as it extends in regard to painting, is divided into
three principal parts; the first consists in the diminution of size,
according to distance; the second concerns the diminution of colours in
such objects; and the third treats of the diminution of the perception
altogether of those objects, and of the degree of precision they ought
to exhibit at various distances.</p>

darkness<a name="FNanchor_74_284" id="FNanchor_74_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_284"
class="fnanchor">[74]</a>; I say of light, because of the moist particles floating
in the air, which reflect the light. By darkness, I mean the pure air,
which has none of these extraneous particles to stop and reflect the
rays. Of this we see an example in the air interposed between the eye
and some dark mountains, rendered so by the shadows of an innumerable
quantity of trees; or else shaded on one side by the natural privation
of the rays of the sun; this air becomes azure, but not so on the side
of the mountain which is light, particularly when it is covered with
snow.</p>

<p>That object which is painted with the most white and the most black,
will shew greater relief than any other; for that reason I would
recommend to painters to colour and dress their figures with the
brightest and most lively colours; for if they are painted of a dull
or obscure colour, they will detach but little, and not be much seen,
when the picture is placed at some distance; because the colour of every
object is obscured in the shades; and if it be represented as originally
so all over, there will be but little difference between the lights and
the shades, while lively colours will shew a striking difference.</p>

<span class="smcap">Chap. CCCIV.</span>&mdash;<i>Aerial Perspective.</i></h4>

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> is another kind of perspective called aerial, because by the
difference of the air it is easy to determine the distance of different
objects, though seen on the same line; such, for instance, as buildings
behind a wall, and appearing all of the same height above it. If in your
picture you want to have one appear more distant than another, you must
first suppose the air somewhat thick, because, as we have said before,
in such a kind of air the objects seen at a great distance, as mountains
are, appear blueish like the air, by means of the great quantity of air
that interposes between the eye and such mountains. You will then paint
the first building behind that wall of its proper colour; the next in
point of distance, less distinct in the outline, and participating, in a
greater degree, of the blueish colour of the air; another which you wish
to send off as much farther, should be painted as much bluer; and if you
wish one of them to appear five times farther removed beyond the wall,
it must have five times more of the azure. By this rule these buildings
which appeared all of the same size, and upon the same line, will be
distinctly perceived to be of different dimensions, and at different
distances.</p>

<p>How many, in the representation of towns, and other objects remote from
the eye, express every part of the buildings in the same manner as if
they were very near. It is not so in nature, because there is no sight
so powerful as to perceive distinctly at any great distance the precise
form of parts or extremities of objects. The painter therefore who
pronounces the outlines, and the minute distinction of parts, as several
have done, will not give the representation of distant objects, but by
this error will make them appear exceedingly near. Again, the angles
of buildings in distant towns are not to be expressed (for they cannot
be seen), considering that angles are formed by the concurrence of two
lines into one point, and that a point has no parts; it is therefore
invisible.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Objects</span> appear smaller than they really are when they are distant from
the eye, and because there is a great deal of air interposed, which
weakens the appearance of forms, and, by a natural consequence, prevents
our seeing distinctly the minute parts of such objects. It behoves
the painter therefore to touch those parts slightly, in an unfinished
manner; otherwise it would be against the effect of Nature, whom he has
chosen for his guide. For, as we said before, objects appear small on
account of their great distance from the eye; that distance includes a
great quantity of air, which, forming a dense body, obstructs the light,
and prevents our seeing the minute parts of the objects.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">As</span> the air is thicker nearer the earth, and becomes thinner as it rises,
look, when the sun is in the east, towards the west, between the north
and south, and you will perceive that the thickest and lowest air will
receive more light from the sun than the thinner air, because its beams
meet with more resistance.</p>

<p>If the sky terminate low, at the end of a plain, that part of it nearest
to the horizon, being seen only through the thick air, will alter and
break its natural<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a>
</span> colour, and will appear whiter than over your head,
where the visual ray does not pass through so much of that gross air,
corrupted by earthy vapours. But if you turn towards the east, the air
will be darker the nearer it approaches the earth; for the air being
thicker, does not admit the light of the sun to pass so freely.</p>

<span class="smcap">Chap. CCCVIII.</span>&mdash;<i>How to paint the distant Part of a Landscape.</i></h4>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is evident that the air is in some parts thicker and grosser than in
others, particularly that nearest to the earth; and as it rises higher,
it becomes thinner and more transparent. The objects which are high and
large, from which you are at some distance, will be less apparent in the
lower parts; because the visual ray which perceives them, passes through
a long space of dense air; and it is easy to prove that the upper parts
are seen by a line, which, though on the side of the eye it originates
in a thick air, nevertheless, as it ascends to the highest summit of its
object, terminates in an air much thinner than that of the lower parts;
and for that reason the more that line or visual ray advances from the
eye, it becomes, in its progress from one point to another, thinner and
thinner, passing from a pure air into another which is purer; so that a
painter who has mountains to represent in a landscape, ought to observe,
that from one hill to another, the tops will appear always clearer than
the bases. In proportion as the distance from one to another is greater,
the top will be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a>

higher. We have said, in Chapter cccxxi. that the air is thicker the
lower it is, and thinner as it is higher. It is demonstrated also by
the cut, where the tower, A F, is seen by the eye N, in a thick air,
from B to F, which is divided into four degrees, growing thicker as they
are nearer the bottom. The less the quantity of air interposed between
the eye and its object is, the less also will the colour of the object
participate of the colour of that air. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172"
id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span> follows, that the greater
the quantity of the air interposed between the eye and the object seen,
is, the more this object will participate of the colour of the air.
It is demonstrated thus: N being the eye looking at the five parts of
the tower A F, viz. A B C D E, I say, that if the air were of the same
thickness, there would be the same proportion between the colour of
the air at the bottom of the tower and the colour of the air that the
same tower has at the place B, as there is in length between the line
M and F. As, however, we have supposed that the air is not of equal
thickness, but, on the contrary, thicker as it is lower, it follows,
that the proportion by which the air tinges the different elevations of
the tower B C F, exceeds the proportion of the lines; because the line M
F, besides its being longer than the line S B, passes by unequal degrees
through a quality of air which is unequal in thickness.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> inferior or lower extremities of distant objects are not so apparent
as the upper extremities. This is observable in mountains and hills,
the tops of which detach from the sides of other mountains behind. We
see the tops of these more determined and distinctly than their bases;
because the upper extremities are darker, being less encompassed by
thick air, which always remains in the lower regions, and makes them
appear dim and confused. It is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173"
id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span> same with trees, buildings, and
other objects high up. From this effect it often happens that a high
tower, seen at a great distance, will appear broad at top, and narrow at
bottom; because the thin air towards the top does not prevent the angles
on the sides and other different parts of the tower from being seen,
as the thick air does at bottom. This is demonstrated by the seventh
proposition<a name="FNanchor_77_287" id="FNanchor_77_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_287"

the eye and the sun, is lighter below than above, and where the air is
whiteish, it confuses the dark objects more than if such air were blueish
or thinner, as it is higher up. The battlements of a fortress have the
spaces between equal to the breadth of the battlement, and yet the space
will appear wider; at a great distance the battlements will appear
very much diminished, and being removed still farther, will disappear
entirely, and the fort shew only the straight wall, as if there were no
battlements.</p>

thing in comparison of such large objects), being still diminished by
the distance, will occupy so little of the eye, that they become almost
imperceptible. Besides, having to pass through a dark medium from the
surface to the <i>Retina</i> in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175"

the colour of faces (not being very strong, and rendered still more
obscure by the darkness of the tube) when arrived at the focus appears
dark. No other reason can be given on that point, except that the speck
in the middle of the apple of the eye is black, and, being full of a
transparent fluid like air, performs the same office as a hole in a
board, which on looking into it appears black; and that those things
which are seen through both a light and dark air, become confused and

at the base. And a square tower, seen at a great distance through a fog,

for in Chapter cccxiii. which says, that the fog will appear whiter and

<span class="smcap">Chap. CCCXX.</span>&mdash;<i>Of Objects seen in a Fog.</i></h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Objects</span> seen through a fog will appear larger than they are in reality,
because the aerial perspective does not agree with the linear, viz. the
colour does not agree with the magnitude of the object<a name="FNanchor_80_290"
id="FNanchor_80_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_290" class="fnanchor">[80]</a>; such a fog
being similar to the thickness of air interposed between the eye and the
horizon in fine weather. But in this case the fog is near the eye, and
though the object be also near, it makes it appear as if it were as far
off as the horizon; where a great tower would appear no bigger than a
man placed near the eye.</p>

through a Mist or thick Air.</i></h4>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> nearer the air is to water, or to the ground, the thicker it
becomes. It is proved by the nineteenth proposition of the second
book<a name="FNanchor_81_291" id="FNanchor_81_291"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_291"
class="fnanchor">[81]</a>, that bodies rise in proportion to their weight; and it
follows, that a light body will rise higher than another which is heavy.</p>

<h4><a name="Chap_CCCXXII" id="Chap_CCCXXII"></a>
<span class="smcap">Chap. CCCXXII.</span>&mdash;<i>Miscellaneous Observations.</i></h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Of</span> different objects equal in magnitude, form, shade, and distance from
the eye, those will appear the smaller that are placed on the lighter
ground. This is exemplified by observing the sun when seen behind a tree
without leaves; all the ramifications seen against that great light
are so diminished that they remain almost invisible. The same may be
observed of a pole placed between the sun and the eye.</p>

<p>Parallel bodies placed upright, and seen through a fog, will
appear larger at top than at bottom. This is proved by the ninth
proposition<a name="FNanchor_82_292" id="FNanchor_82_292"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_292"
class="fnanchor">[82]</a>, which says, that a fog, or thick air, penetrated by
the rays of the sun, will appear whiter the lower they are.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span></p>

<p>Things seen afar off will appear out of proportion, because the parts
which are the lightest will send their image with stronger rays than the
parts which are darkest. I have seen a woman dressed in black, with a
white veil over her head, which appeared twice as large as her shoulders
covered with black.</p>

<span class="smcap">Chap. CCCXXIII.</span>&mdash;<i>Of Objects seen at a Distance.</i></h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Any</span> dark object will appear lighter when removed to some distance from
the eye. It follows, by the contrary reason, that a dark object will
appear still darker when brought nearer to the eye. Therefore the
inferior parts of any object whatever, placed in thick air, will appear
farther from the eye at the bottom than at the top; for that reason the
lower parts of a mountain appear farther off than its top, which is in
reality the farthest.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> eye which, looking downwards, sees a town immersed in very thick
air, will perceive the top of the buildings darker, but more distinct
than the bottom. The tops detach against a light ground, because they
are seen against the low and thick air which is beyond them. This is a
consequence of what has been explained in the preceding chapter.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Those</span> greens will appear to approach nearest to blue which are

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> the sea is a little ruffled it has no sameness of colour; for
whoever looks at it from the shore, will see it of a dark colour, in a
greater degree as it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a>
</span> approaches towards the horizon, and will perceive
also certain lights moving slowly on the surface like a flock of sheep.
Whoever looks at the sea from on board a ship, at a distance from the
land, sees it blue. Near the shore it appears darkish, on account of the
colour of the earth reflected by the water, as in a looking-glass; but
at sea the azure of the air is reflected to the eye by the waves in the
same manner.</p>

<h4><a name="Chap_CCCXXIX" id="Chap_CCCXXIX"></a>
<span class="smcap">Chap. CCCXXIX.</span>&mdash;<i>Why the same Prospect appears larger at some
Times than at others.</i></h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Objects</span> in the country appear sometimes larger and sometimes smaller
than they actually are, from the circumstance of the air interposed
between the eye and the horizon, happening to be either thicker or
thinner than usual.</p>

<p>Of two horizons equally distant from the eye, that which is seen through
the thicker air will appear farther removed; and the other will seem
nearer, being seen through a thinner air.</p>

<p>Objects of unequal size, but equally distant, will appear equal if the
air which is between them and the eye be of proportionable inequality
of thickness, viz. if the thickest air be interposed between the eye
and the smallest of the objects. This is proved by the perspective of
colours<a name="FNanchor_84_294" id="FNanchor_84_294"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_294"
class="fnanchor">[84]</a>, which is so deceitful that a mountain which would appear
small by the compasses, will seem larger than a small hill near<span class="pagenum">

<span class="smcap">Chap. CCCXXX.</span>&mdash;<i>Of Smoke.</i></h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Smoke</span> is more transparent, though darker towards the extremities of its
waves than in the middle.</p>

<p>It moves in a more oblique direction in proportion to the force of the
wind which impels it.</p>

<p>Different kinds of smoke vary in colour, as the causes that produce them
are various.</p>

<p>Smoke never produces determined shadows, and the extremities are lost
as they recede from their primary cause. Objects behind it are less
apparent in proportion to the thickness of the smoke. It is whiter
nearer its origin, and bluer towards its termination.</p>

<p>Fire appears darker, the more smoke there is interposed between it and
the eye.</p>

<p>Where smoke is farther distant, the objects are less confused by it.</p>

<p>It encumbers and dims all the landscape like a fog. Smoke is seen to
issue from different places, with flames at the origin, and the most
dense part of it. The tops of mountains will be more seen than the lower
parts, as in a fog.</p>

<h4><a name="Chap_CCCXXXI" id="Chap_CCCXXXI"></a>
<span class="smcap">Chap. CCCXXXI.</span>&mdash;<i>In what Part Smoke is lightest.</i></h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Smoke</span> which is seen between the sun and the eye will be lighter and more
transparent than any other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a>

dust, and of fog; while, if you place yourself between the sun and those

<h4><a name="Chap_CCCXXXII" id="Chap_CCCXXXII"></a>
<span class="smcap">Chap. CCCXXXII.</span>&mdash;<i>Of the Sun-beams passing through the Openings

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> sun-beams which penetrate the openings interposed between clouds
of various density and form, illuminate all the places over which they
pass, and tinge with their own colour all the dark places that are
behind: which dark places are only seen in the intervals between the
rays.</p>

<h4><a name="Chap_CCCXXXIII" id="Chap_CCCXXXIII"></a>
<span class="smcap">Chap. CCCXXXIII.</span>&mdash;<i>Of the Beginning of Rain.</i></h4>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> the rain begins to fall, it tarnishes and darkens the air, giving
it a dull colour, but receives still on one side a faint light from
the sun, and is shaded on the other side, as we observe in clouds;
till at last it darkens also the earth, depriving it entirely of the
light of the sun. Objects seen through the rain appear confused and of
undetermined shape, but those which are near will be more distinct.
It is observable, that on the side where the rain is shaded, objects
will be more clearly distinguished than where it receives the light;
because on the shady side they lose only their principal lights, whilst
on the other they lose both their lights and shadows, the lights mixing
with the light part of the rain, and the shadows are also considerably
weakened by it.</p>

trees of every kind (though at equal distance) with the same quality

that the colour of it cannot be either lighter or darker than that of
the neighbouring objects.</p>

</span> and muddy; because clear water being polished and
smooth on its surface, the image of the bridge is formed in it as in
a looking-glass, and reflected in all the points situated between the
eye and the bridge at equal angles; and even the air is seen under the
arches. These circumstances cannot happen when the water is muddy,
because it does not reflect the objects any longer, but receives the
shadow of the bridge in the same manner as a dusty road would receive it.</p>

<h4><a name="Chap_CCCXLI" id="Chap_CCCXLI"></a>
<span class="smcap">Chap. CCCXLI.</span>&mdash;<i>How a Painter ought to put in Practice the
Perspective of Colours.</i></h4>

<p><span class="smcap">To</span> put in practice that perspective which teaches the alteration, the
lessening, and even the entire loss of the very essence of colours, you
must take some points in the country at the distance of about sixty-five
yards<a name="FNanchor_86_296" id="FNanchor_86_296"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_296"
class="fnanchor">[86]</a> from each other; as trees, men, or some other remarkable
objects. In regard to the first tree, you will take a glass, and having
fixed that well, and also your eye, draw upon it, with the greatest
accuracy, the tree you see through it; then put it a little on one side,
and compare it closely with the natural one, and colour it, so that in
shape and colour it may resemble the original, and that by shutting one
eye they may both appear painted, and at the same distance. The same
rule may be applied to the second and third tree at the distance you
have fixed. These<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a>
</span> studies will be very useful if managed with judgment,
where they may be wanted in the offscape of a picture. I have observed
that the second tree is less by four fifths than the first, at the
distance of thirteen yards.</p>

<h4><a name="Chap_CCCXLII" id="Chap_CCCXLII"></a>
<span class="smcap">Chap. CCCXLII.</span>&mdash;<i>Various Precepts in Painting.</i></h4>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> superficies of any opake body participates of the colour of the
transparent medium interposed between the eye and such body, in a
greater or less degree, in proportion to the density of such medium and
the space it occupies.</p>

<p>The outlines of opake bodies will be less apparent in proportion as
those bodies are farther distant from the eye.</p>

<p>That part of the opake body will be the most shaded, or lightest, which
is nearest to the body that shades it, or gives it light.</p>

<p>The surface of any opake body participates more or less of the colour of
that body which gives it light, in proportion as the latter is more or
less remote, or more or less strong.</p>

<p>Objects seen between lights and shadows will appear to have greater
relievo than those which are placed wholly in the light, or wholly in
shadow.</p>

<p>When you give strength and precision to objects seen at a great
distance, they will appear as if they were very near. Endeavour that
your imitation be such as to give a just idea of distances. If the
object<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a>
</span> in nature appear confused in the outlines, let the same be
observed in your picture.</p>

<p>The outlines of distant objects appear undetermined and confused,
for two reasons: the first is, that they come to the eye by so small
an angle, and are therefore so much diminished, that they strike the
sight no more than small objects do, which though near can hardly be
distinguished, such as the nails of the fingers, insects, and other
similar things: the second is, that between the eye and the distant
objects there is so much air interposed, that it becomes thick; and,
like a veil, tinges the shadows with its own whiteness, and turns them
from a dark colour to another between black and white, such as azure.</p>

<p>Although, by reason of the great distance, the appearance of many things
is lost, yet those things which receive the light from the sun will be
more discernible, while the rest remain enveloped in confused shadows.
And because the air is thicker near the ground, the things which are
lower will appear confused; and <i>vice vers√¢</i>.</p>

<p>When the sun tinges the clouds on the horizon with red, those objects
which, on account of their distance, appear blueish, will participate
of that redness, and will produce a mixture between the azure and red,
which renders the prospect lively and pleasant; all the opake bodies
which receive that light will appear distinct, and of a reddish colour,
and the air, being transparent, will be impregnated with it, and appear
of the colour of lilies<a name="FNanchor_87_297" id="FNanchor_87_297"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_87_297" class="fnanchor">[87]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span></p>

<p>The air which is between the earth and the sun when it rises or sets,
will always dim the objects it surrounds, more than the air any where
else, because it is whiter.</p>

<p>It is not necessary to mark strongly the outlines of any object which is
placed upon another. It ought to detach of itself.</p>

<p>If the outline or extremity of a white and curved surface terminate upon
another white body, it will have a shade at that extremity, darker than
any part of the light; but if against a dark object, such outline, or
extremity, will be lighter than any part of the light.</p>

<p>Those objects which are most different in colour, will appear the most
detached from each other.</p>

<p>Those parts of objects which first disappear in the distance, are
extremities similar in colour, and ending one upon the other, as the
extremities of an oak tree upon another oak similar to it. The next to
disappear at a greater distance are, objects of mixed colours, when they
terminate one upon the other, as trees, ploughed fields, walls, heaps of
rubbish, or of stones. The last extremities of bodies that vanish are
those which, being light, terminate upon a dark ground; or being dark,
upon a light ground.</p>

<p>Of objects situated above the eye, at equal heights, the farthest
removed from the eye will appear the lowest; and if situated below
the eye, the nearest to it will appear the lowest. The parallel lines
situated sidewise will concur to one point<a name="FNanchor_88_298" id="FNanchor_88_298">
</a><a href="#Footnote_88_298" class="fnanchor">[88]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span></p>

<p>Those objects which are near a river, or a lake, in the distant part of
a landscape, are less apparent and distinct than those that are remote
from them.</p>

<p>Of bodies of equal density, those that are nearest to the eye will
appear thinnest, and the most remote thickest.</p>

<p>A large eye-ball will see objects larger than a small one. The
experiment may be made by looking at any of the celestial bodies,
through a pin-hole, which being capable of admitting but a portion
of its light, it seems to diminish and lose of its size in the same
proportion as the pin-hole is smaller than the usual apparent size of
the object.</p>

<p>A thick air interposed between the eye and any object, will render the
outlines of such object undetermined and confused, and make it appear of
a larger size than it is in reality; because the linear perspective does
not diminish the angle which conveys the object to the eye. The aerial
perspective carries it farther off, so that the one removes it from the
eye, while the other preserves its magnitude<a name="FNanchor_89_299" id="FNanchor_89_299"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_89_299" class="fnanchor">[89]</a>.</p>

<p>When the sun is in the West the vapours of the earth fall down again
and thicken the air, so that objects not enlightened by the sun remain
dark and confused, but those which receive its light will be tinged
yellow and red, according to the sun&rsquo;s appearance on the horizon. Again,
those that receive its light are very distinct, particularly public
buildings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a>
</span> and houses in towns and villages, because their shadows are
dark, and it seems as if those parts which are plainly seen were coming
out of confused and undetermined foundations, because at that time every
thing is of one and the same colour, except what is enlightened by the
sun<a name="FNanchor_90_300" id="FNanchor_90_300"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_300"
class="fnanchor">[90]</a>.</p>

<p>Any object receiving the light from the sun, receives also the general
light; so that two kinds of shadows are produced: the darkest of the
two is that which happens to have its central line directed towards the
centre of the sun. The central lines of the primitive and secondary
lights are the same as the central lines of the primitive and secondary
shadows.</p>

<p>The setting sun is a beautiful and magnificent object when it tinges
with its colour all the great buildings of towns, villages, and the top
of high trees in the country. All below is confused and almost lost in
a tender and general mass; for, being only enlightened by the air, the
difference between the shadows and the lights is small, and for that
reason it is not much detached. But those that are high are touched
by the rays of the sun, and, as was said before, are tinged with its
colour; the painter therefore ought to take the same colour with which
he has painted the sun, and employ it in all those parts of his work
which receive its light.</p>

<p>It also happens very often, that a cloud will appear<span class="pagenum">
<a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span> dark without
receiving any shadow from a separate cloud, according to the situation
of the eye; because it will see only the shady part of the one, while it
sees both the enlightened and shady parts of the other.</p>

<p class="bottom1">Of two objects at equal height, that which is the farthest off will
appear the lowest. Observe the first cloud in the cut, though it
is lower than the second, it appears as if it were higher. This is
demonstrated by the section of the pyramidical rays of the low cloud at
M A, and the second (which is higher) at N M, below M A. This happens
also when, on account of the rays of the setting or rising sun, a dark
cloud appears higher than another which is light.</p>

and cove, of the same shape and dimension, as that upon which you are
to paint. Then draw also the profile of your figure, of whatever size
you please, by the side of it; draw all the lines to the point F, and
where they intersect the profile M R, you will have the dimensions of
your figure as they ought to be drawn upon the real spot. You will find,
that on the straight part of the wall M N, it will come of its proper
form, because the going off perpendicularly will diminish it naturally;
but that part which comes upon the curve will be diminished upon your
drawing. The whole must be traced afterwards upon the real spot, which
is similar to M N. This is a good and safe method.</p>

will not appear to have the same Relief as Nature itself.</i></h4>

<p class="bottom1"><span class="smcap">If</span> nature is seen with two eyes, it will be impossible to imitate it
upon a picture so as to appear with the same relief, though the lines,
the lights, shades, and colour, be perfectly imitated<a name="FNanchor_94_304"
id="FNanchor_94_304"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_304" class="fnanchor">[94]</a>. It is proved
thus: let the eyes A B, look at the object C, with the concurrence of
both the central visual rays A C<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198"
id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span> and B C. I say, that the sides of the
visual angles (which contain these central rays) will see the space G D,
behind the object C. The eye A will see all the space FD, and the eye
B all the space G E. Therefore the two eyes will see behind the object
C all the space F E; for which reason that object C becomes as it were
transparent, according to the definition of transparent bodies, behind
which nothing is hidden. This cannot happen if an object were seen with
one eye only, provided it be larger than the eye. From all that has been
said, we may conclude, that a painted object, occupying all the space it
has behind, leaves no possible way to see any part of the ground, which
it covers entirely by its own circumference<a name="FNanchor_95_305"

<span class="smcap">Chap. CCCXLIX.</span>&mdash;<i>Universality of Painting; a Precept.</i></h4>

<p><span class="smcap">A painter</span> cannot be said to aim at universality in the art, unless he
love equally every species of that art. For instance, if he delight
only in landscape, his can be esteemed only as a simple investigation;
and, as our friend Botticello<a name="FNanchor_96_306" id="FNanchor_96_306"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_96_306" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> remarks, is but a vain study; since,
by throwing a sponge impregnated with various colours against a wall,
it leaves some spots upon it, which may appear like a landscape. It is
true also, that a variety of compositions may be seen in such spots,
according to the disposition of mind with which they are considered;
such as heads of men, various animals, battles, rocky scenes, seas,
clouds, woods, and the like. It may be compared to the sound of bells,
which may seem to say whatever we choose to imagine. In the same manner
also, those spots may furnish hints for compositions, though they do not
teach us how to finish any particular part; and the imitators of them
are but sorry landscape-painters.</p>

<h4><a name="Chap_CCCL" id="Chap_CCCL"></a>
<span class="smcap">Chap. CCCL.</span>&mdash;<i>In what Manner the Mirror is the true Master of
Painters.</i></h4>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> you wish to know if your picture be like the object you mean to
represent, have a flat looking-glass, and place it so as to reflect the
object you have imitated, and compare carefully the original with the
copy. You see upon a flat mirror the representation of things which
appear real; Painting is the same. They are both an even superficies,
and both give the idea of something beyond their superficies. Since you
are persuaded that the looking-glass, by means of lines and shades,
gives you the representation of things as if they were real; you being
in possession of colours which in their different lights and shades are
stronger than those of the looking-glass, may certainly, if you employ
the rules with judgment, give to your picture the same appearance of
Nature as you admire in the looking-glass. Or rather, your picture will
be like Nature itself seen in a large looking-glass.</p>

<p>This looking-glass (being your master) will shew you the lights and
shades of any object whatever. Amongst your colours there are some
lighter than the lightest part of your model, and also some darker than
the strongest shades; from which it follows, that you ought to represent
Nature as seen in your looking-glass, when you look at it with one eye
only; because both eyes surround the objects too much, particularly when
they are small<a name="FNanchor_97_307" id="FNanchor_97_307"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_307"

<h4><a name="Chap_CCCLI" id="Chap_CCCLI"></a>
<span class="smcap">Chap. CCCLI.</span>&mdash;<i>Which Painting is to be esteemed the best.</i></h4>

<p><span class="smcap">That</span> painting is the most commendable which has the greatest conformity
to what is meant to be imitated. This kind of comparison will often put
to shame a certain description of painters, who pretend they can mend
the works of Nature; as they do, for instance, when they pretend to
represent a child twelve months old, giving him eight heads in height,
when Nature in its best proportion admits but five. The breadth of the
shoulders also, which is equal to the head, they make double, giving
to a child a year old, the proportions of a man of thirty. They have
so often practised, and seen others practise these errors, that they
have converted them into habit, which has taken so deep a root in their
corrupted judgment, that they persuade themselves that Nature and her
imitators are wrong in not following their own practice<a name="FNanchor_98_308"

<h4><a name="Chap_CCCLII" id="Chap_CCCLII"></a>
<span class="smcap">Chap. CCCLII.</span>&mdash;<i>Of the Judgment to be made of a Painter&rsquo;s Work.</i></h4>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> first thing to be considered is, whether the figures have their
proper relief, according to their respective situations, and the light
they are in: that the shadows be not the same at the extremities of
the groups, as in the middle; because being surrounded by<span class="pagenum">
<a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span> shadows, or
shaded only on one side, produce very different effects. The groups in
the middle are surrounded by shadows from the other figures, which are
between them and the light. Those which are at the extremities have
the shadows only on one side, and receive the light on the other. The
strongest and smartest touches of shadows are to be in the interstice
between the figures of the principal group where the light cannot
penetrate<a name="FNanchor_99_309" id="FNanchor_99_309"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_309"
class="fnanchor">[99]</a>.</p>

<p>Secondly, that by the order and disposition of the figures they appear
to be accommodated to the subject, and the true representation of the
history in question.</p>

<p>Thirdly, that the figures appear alive to the occasion which brought
them together, with expressions suited to their attitudes.</p>

<span class="smcap">Chap. CCCLIII.</span>&mdash;<i>How to make an imaginary Animal appear
natural.</i></h4>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is evident that it will be impossible to invent any animal without
giving it members, and these members must individually resemble those of
some known animal.</p>

<p>If you wish, therefore, to make a chimera, or imaginary animal, appear
natural (let us suppose a serpent); take the head of a mastiff, the eyes
of a cat, the ears of a porcupine, the mouth of a hare, the brows of a
lion, the temples of an old cock, and the neck of a sea tortoise<a name="FNanchor_100_310"

<h4><a name="Chap_CCCLIV" id="Chap_CCCLIV"></a>
<span class="smcap">Chap. CCCLIV.</span>&mdash;<i>Painters are not to imitate one another.</i></h4>

<p><span class="smcap">One</span> painter ought never to imitate the manner of any other; because in
that case he cannot be called the child of Nature, but the grandchild.
It is always best to have recourse to Nature, which is replete with such
abundance of objects, than to the productions of other masters, who
learnt every thing from her.</p>

<span class="smcap">Chap. CCCLV.</span>&mdash;<i>How to judge of one&rsquo;s own Work.</i></h4>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is an acknowledged fact, that we perceive errors in the works of
others more readily than in our own. A painter, therefore, ought to
be well instructed in perspective, and acquire a perfect knowledge of
the dimensions of the human body; he should also be a good architect,
at least as far as concerns the outward shape of buildings, with their
different parts; and where he is deficient, he ought not to neglect
taking drawings from Nature.</p>

<p>It will be well also to have a looking-glass by him, when he paints,
to look often at his work in it, which being seen the contrary way,
will appear as the work of another hand, and will better shew his
faults. It will be useful also to quit his work often, and take some
relaxation, that his judgment may be clearer at his return; for too
great application and sitting still is sometimes the cause of many gross
errors.</p>

<h4><a name="Chap_CCCLVI" id="Chap_CCCLVI"></a>
<span class="smcap">Chap. CCCLVI.</span>&mdash;<i>Of correcting Errors which you discover.</i></h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Remember</span>, that when, by the exercise of your own judgment, or the
observation of others, you discover any errors in your work, you
immediately set about correcting them, lest, in exposing your works to
the public, you expose your defects also. Admit not any self-excuse, by
persuading yourself that you shall retrieve your character, and that by
some succeeding work you shall make amends for your shameful negligence;
for your work does not perish as soon as it is out of your hands, like
the sound of music, but remains a standing monument of your ignorance.
If you excuse yourself by saying that you have not time for the study
necessary to form a great painter, having to struggle against necessity,
you yourself are only to blame; for the study of what is excellent
is food both for mind and body. How many philosophers, born to great
riches, have given them away, that they might not be retarded in their
pursuits!</p>

<span class="smcap">Chap. CCCLVII.</span>&mdash;<i>The best Place for looking at a Picture.</i></h4>

<p class="bottom1"><span class="smcap">Let</span> us suppose, that A B is the picture, receiving the light from D; I
say, that whoever is placed between C and E, will see the picture very
badly, particularly if it be painted in oil, or varnished; because it
will shine, and will appear almost of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205"
id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span> nature of a looking-glass.
For these reasons, the nearer you go towards C, the less you will be
able to see, because of the light from the window upon the picture,
sending its reflection to that point. But if you place yourself between
E D, you may conveniently see the picture, and the more so as you draw
nearer to the point D, because that place is less liable to be struck by
the reflected rays.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">To</span> execute a figure in marble, you must first make a model of it in
clay, or plaster, and when it is finished, place it in a square case,
equally capable of receiving the block of marble intended to be shaped
like it. Have some peg-like sticks to pass through holes made in the
sides, and all round the case; push them in till every one touches the
model, marking what remains of the sticks outwards with ink, and making
a countermark to every stick and its hole, so that you may at pleasure
replace them again. Then having taken out the model, and placed the
block of marble in its stead, take so much out of it, till all the pegs
go in at the same holes to the marks you had made. To facilitate the
work, contrive your frame so that every part of it, separately, or all
together, may be lifted up, except the bottom, which<span class="pagenum">
<a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span> must remain under

<span class="label">[i37]</span></a> Additions to the Life in Vasari, 53. My worthy
friend, Mr. Rigaud, who has more than once seen the original picture,
gives this account of it: &ldquo;The cutting of the wall for the sake of
opening a door, was no doubt the effect of ignorance and barbarity, but
it did not materially injure the painting; it only took away some of the
feet under the table, entirely shaded. The true value of this picture
consists in what was seen above the table. The door is only four feet
wide, and cuts off only about two feet of the lower part of the picture.
More damage has been done by subsequent quacks, who, within my own time,
have undertaken to repair it.&rdquo;</p>

<span class="label">[i39]</span></a> COPIES EXISTING IN MILAN OR ELSEWHERE.</p>

<p>
No. 1. That in the refectory of the fathers Osservanti della Pace: it
was painted on the wall in 1561, by Gio. Paolo Lomazzo.
</p>
<p>
2. Another, copied on board, as a picture in the refectory of the
Chierici Regolari di S. Paolo, in their college of St. Barnabas. This
is perhaps the most beautiful that can be seen, only that it is not
finished lower than the knees, and is in size about one eighth of the
original.
</p>
<p>
3. Another on canvas, which was first in the church of S. Fedele, by
Agostino S. Agostino, for the refectory of the Jesuits: since their
suppression, it exists in that of the Orfani a S. Pietro, in Gessate.
</p>
<p>
4. Another of the said Lomazzo&rsquo;s, painted on the wall in the monastery
Maggiore, very fine, and in good preservation.
</p>
<p>
5. Another on canvas, by an uncertain artist, with only the heads and
half the bodies, in the Ambrosian library.
</p>
<p>
6. Another in the Certosa di Pavia, done by Marco d&rsquo;Ogionno, a scholar
of Leonardo&rsquo;s, on the wall.
</p>
<p>
7. Another in the possession of the monks Girolamini di Castellazzo
fuori di Porta Lodovica, of the hand of the same Ogionno.
</p>
<p>
8. Another copy of this Last Supper in the refectory of the fathers
of St. Benedict of Mantua. It was painted by Girolamo Monsignori, a
Dominican friar, who studied much the works of Leonardo, and copied them
excellently.
</p>
<p>
9. Another in the refectory of the fathers Osservanti di Lugano, of the
hand of Bernardino Lovino; a valuable work, and much esteemed as well
for its neatness and perfect imitation of the original, as for its own
integrity, and being done by a scholar of Leonardo&rsquo;s.
</p>
<p>
10. A beautiful drawing of this famous picture is, or was lately, in the
possession of Sig. Giuseppe Casati, king at arms. Supposed to be either
the original design by Leonardo himself, or a sketch by one of his best
scholars, to be used in painting some copy on a wall, or on canvas. It
is drawn with a pen, on paper larger than usual, with a mere outline
heightened with bistre.
</p>
<p>
11. Another in the refectory of the fathers Girolamini, in the monastery
of St. Laurence, in the Escurial in Spain. It was presented to King
Philip II. while he was in Valentia; and by his order placed in the said
room where the monks dine, and is believed to be by some able scholar of
Leonardo.
</p>
<p>
12. Another in St. Germain d&rsquo;Auxerre, in France; ordered by King Francis
I. when he came to Milan, and found he could not remove the original.
There is reason to think this the work of Bernardino Lovino.
</p>
<p>
13. Another in France, in the castle of Escovens, in the possession of
the Constable Montmorency.
</p>
<p>
The original drawing for this picture is in the possession of his
Britannic Majesty. See the life prefixed to Mr. Chamberlaine&rsquo;s
publication of the Designs of Leonardo da Vinci, p. 5. An engraving from
it is among those which Mr. Rogers published from drawings.</p>

Lovino was a scholar of Leonardo, and had in his possession the carton
of St. Ann, which Leonardo had made for a picture which he was to paint
in the church della Nunziata, at Florence. Francis I. got possession of
it, and was desirous that Leonardo should execute it when he came into
France, but without effect. It is known it was not done, as this carton
went to Milan. Lomazzo, lib. ii. cap. 17. Lett. Pitt. vol. ii. p. 174,

and supposed to require, that the student should be a deep proficient

a knowledge of the leading principles only of perspective that the

<span class="label">[4]</span></a> From this, and many other similar passages, it is
evident, that the author intended at some future time to arrange his
manuscript collections, and to publish them as separate treatises.
That he did not do so is well known; but it is also a fact, that, in
selecting from the whole mass of his collections the chapters of which
the present work consists, great care appears in general to have been
taken to extract also those to which there was any reference from any of
the chapters intended for this work, or which from their subject were
necessarily connected with them. Accordingly, the reader will find, in
the notes to this translation, that all such chapters in any other part
of the present work are uniformly pointed out, as have any relation to
the respective passages in the text. This, which has never before been
done, though indispensably necessary, will be found of singular use, and
it was thought proper here, once for all, to notice it.
</p>
<p>
In the present instance the chapters, referring to the subject in the
text, are Chap. xvi. xvii. xviii. xix. xx. xxvi.; and though these
do not afford complete information, yet it is to be remembered, that
drawing from relievos is subject to the very same rules as drawing from
Nature; and that, therefore, what is elsewhere said on that subject is
also equally applicable to this.</p>

<span class="label">[22]</span></a> The author here means to compare the different quickness
of the motion of the head and the heel, when employed in the same action
of jumping; and he states the proportion of the former to be three times
that of the latter. The reason he gives for this is in substance, that
as the head has but one motion to make, while in fact the lower part of
the figure has three successive operations to perform at the places he
mentions, three times the velocity, or, in other words, three times the
degree of effort, is necessary in the head, the prime mover, to give the
power of influencing the other parts; and the rule deducible from this
axiom is, that where two different parts of the body concur in the same
action, and one of them has to perform one motion only, while the other
is to have several, the proportion of velocity or effort in the former
must be regulated by the number of operations necessary in the latter.</p>

picture cannot be hung over another. It certainly may, because, in
viewing each, the spectator is at liberty (especially if they are
subjects independent of each other) to shift his place so as to stand
at the true point of sight for viewing every one of them; but in
covering a wall with a succession of subjects from the same history, the
author considers the whole as, in fact, but one picture, divided into
compartments, and to be seen at one view, and which cannot therefore
admit more than one point of sight. In the former case, the pictures are
in fact so many distinct subjects unconnected with each other.</p>

<p>
This chapter is obscure, and may probably be made clear by merely
stating it in other words. Leonardo objects to the use of both eyes,
because, in viewing in that manner the objects here mentioned, two
balls, one behind the other, the second is seen, which would not be the
case, if the angle of the visual rays were not too big for the first
object. Whoever is at all acquainted with optics, need not be told, that
the visual rays commence in a single point in the centre, or nearly the
centre of each eye, and continue diverging. But, in using both eyes,
the visual rays proceed not from one and the same centre, but from a
different centre in each eye, and intersecting each other, as they do
a little before passing the first object, they become together broader
than the extent of the first object, and consequently give a view of
part of the second. On the contrary, in using but one eye, the visual
rays proceed but from one centre; and as, therefore, there cannot be
any intersection, the visual rays, when they reach the first object,
are not broader than the first object, and the second is completely
hidden. Properly speaking, therefore, in using both eyes we introduce
more than one point of sight, which renders the perspective false in the
painting; but in using one eye only, there can be, as there ought, but
one point of sight. There is, however, this difference between viewing
real objects and those represented in painting, that in looking at the
former, whether we use one or both eyes, the objects, by being actually
detached from the back ground, admit the visual rays to strike on them,
so as to form a correct perspective, from whatever point they are
viewed, and the eye accordingly forms a perspective of its own; but in
viewing the latter, there is no possibility of varying the perspective;
and, unless the picture is seen precisely under the same angle as it was
painted under, the perspective in all other views must be false. This is
observable in the perspective views painted for scenes at the playhouse.
If the beholder is seated in the central line of the house, whether in
the boxes or pit, the perspective is correct; but, in proportion as he
is placed at a greater or less distance to the right or left of that
line, the perspective appears to him more or less faulty. And hence
arises the necessity of using but one eye in viewing a painting, in
order thereby to reduce it to one point of sight.</p>

chapter, saying, that the invention of enamel painting found out since
the time of Leonardo da Vinci, would better answer to the title of this
chapter, and also be a better method of painting. I must beg leave,
however, to dissent from this opinion, as the two kinds of painting
are so different, that they cannot be compared. Leonardo treats of oil
painting, but the other is vitrification. Leonardo is known to have
spent a great deal of time in experiments, of which this is a specimen,
and it may appear ridiculous to the practitioners of more modern date,
as he does not enter more fully into a minute description of the
materials, or the mode of employing them. The principle laid down in the
text appears to me to be simply this: to make the oil entirely evaporate
from the colours by the action of fire, and afterwards to prevent
the action of the air by the means of a glass, which in itself is an
excellent principle, but not applicable, any more than enamel painting
to large works.</p>

this (which has been reprinted with an English translation, by Colonel

distance of any object seen from afar, it is necessary that we consider
how much of distinctness an object loses at a distance (from the mere
interposition of the air), as well as what it loses in size; and these
two considerations must unite before we can decidedly pronounce as to
its distance or magnitude. This calculation, as to distinctness, must
be made upon the idea that the air is clear, as, if by any accident it
is otherwise, we shall (knowing the proportion in which clear air dims
a prospect) be led to conclude this farther off than it is, and, to
justify that conclusion, shall suppose its real magnitude correspondent
with the distance, at which from its degree of distinctness it appears
to be. In the circumstance remarked in the text there is, however, a
great deception; the fact is, that the colour and the minute parts of
the object are lost in the fog, while the size of it is not diminished
in proportion; and the eye being accustomed to see objects diminished in
size at a great distance, supposes this to be farther off than it is,
and consequently imagines it larger.</p>

in the text, for further illustration. It may, however, be proper to
remark, that though the author has here supposed both objects conveyed
to the eye by an angle of the same extent, they cannot, in fact, be so
seen, unless one eye be shut; and the reason is this: if viewed with
both eyes, there will be two points of sight, one in the centre of each
eye; and the rays from each of these to the objects must of course be
different, and will consequently form different angles.</p>

preceding, depends on the circumstance of there being in fact two points
of sight, one in the centre of each eye, when an object is viewed
with both eyes. In natural objects the effect which this circumstance
produces is, that the rays from each point of sight, diverging as they
extend towards the object, take in not only that, but some part also of
the distance behind it, till at length, at a certain distance behind
it, they cross each other; whereas, in a painted representation, there
being no real distance behind the object, but the whole being a flat
surface, it is impossible that the rays from the points of sight should
pass beyond that flat surface; and as the object itself is on that
flat surface, which is the real extremity of the view, the eyes cannot
acquire a sight of any thing beyond.</p>

being the method generally used by the painters for measuring their
figures, as being too minute, this chapter was not introduced amongst
those of general proportions.</p>

<p class="bold">Transcriber&rsquo;s Note:</p>

<p>This e-text is based on the 1802 edition. The original spelling has been retained,
as well as inconsistencies, such as &lsquo;musquetry&rsquo;/&lsquo;musketry&rsquo;,
&lsquo;Du Fr√™ne&rsquo;/&lsquo;du Fresne&rsquo;, &lsquo;Melzio&rsquo;/&lsquo;Meltio&rsquo;/&lsquo;Melzi&rsquo;, etc.
Uncommon or old-style spelling has not been altered,
such as &lsquo;opake&rsquo; (opaque), &lsquo;verdegris&rsquo; (verdigris), &lsquo;dutchess&rsquo; (duchess), etc.
Errors due to bad print, as well as minor punctuation errors have been tacitly corrected.</p>

<p>In the text, the plates are referenced by using Roman numerals, whereas the
captions of the plates show Arabic numerals; the same applies to the Table of
Chapters and the chapter headings, respectively. This inconsistency has been retained.</p>

<p>Footnotes related to itroductory chapters have been prefixed with
the letter &lsquo;i&rsquo; ([i1]&ndash;[i210]); footnotes in da Vinci&rsquo;s own
text, however, are shown as plain Arabic numerals ([1]&ndash;[102]).</p>

<p>The following typographical errors have been corrected:</p>

<p>
# p. <a href="#Page_xviii">xviii</a>: &lsquo;overspead&rsquo; &#8594; &lsquo;overspread&rsquo;;
&lsquo;Vincius ast oculis&rsquo; &rarr; &lsquo;Vincius est oculis&rsquo;<br />
